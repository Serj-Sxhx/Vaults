The conventional wisdom was that the key is repetition: if one repeatedly has similar experiences under similar circumstances, then one is supposed to ‘extrapolate’ or ‘generalize’ that pattern and predict that it will continue. 

That alleged process was called ‘inductive inference’ or

‘induction’, and the doctrine that scientific theories are obtained in that

way is called inductivism. To bridge the logical gap, some inductivists

imagine that there is a principle of nature – the ‘principle of induction’ –

that makes inductive inferences likely to be true. ‘The future will

resemble the past’ is one popular version of this, and one could add

‘the distant resembles the near,’ ‘the unseen resembles the seen’ and

so on.

### Falibalism 


Fallibilists expect even their best and most

fundamental explanations to contain misconceptions in addition to

truth, and so they are predisposed to try to change them for the better.

      

So it is fallibilism, not mere rejection of authority, that is

essential for the initiation of unlimited knowledge growth – the

beginning of infinity.


### Conjecture 

      

We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up

there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache,

or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’,

‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain

itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we

consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously

fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every

optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it

really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.
