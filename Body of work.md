Hey I'm Serj Hunt, Founder CEO of City as a School. 

I want to play an infinite game,

Not some VC backed 30 year average, 9/10 chance of success type thing. Some thing we can play for 100s of years together. 

The infinite game of knowledge creation.

There is no end so let's stop competing and enjoy the process together.

My team an I are exploring a big question. How can our built and information environments (the see of data we sim in everyday - the internet) become games that help you understand yourself, how the world works and build competencies that help you positively contribute to society?

To answer this question we'll need to network 100 positive sum friends together and live within a 10 min walking distance from eachother for decades at a time in neighbourhoods.

I hope to leave this body of work public so that others can walk through my thinking, replicate, debate, critique what i'm doing, so that we can keep  infinitely creating new knowledge together.

work that explains how I've tried to approach the above question?

What is a human
What supports it's 

Scale through thoughts and abstract back to material then back to abstract.

**What is a human**

Thoughts
Memory
Emotions
Associations
Perceptions
Actions 
Attention
Intentions 

- Subconcious / concious mind
- 7 Criteria 
- Parts and whole - gestalt and feature list
- Am I the spirit - Josha Bach Definition 
- Many selves IFS, mythology many competing agents. 
- IEEE Standards for humans and metrics.
- Different but the same as my child photos.
	- Something that is outside of time.
- I am not the body, Time and space are not fundamental.
- Not my thoughts - Surely I'm my genes? 
- Am I fungible? Quantum entanglement 
- So I'm everything everywhere all at once!
- Process view of the human - Whitehead / Russel 
- I cannot find a human, or a self,
- The closes thing I could say that a human is a wave on an ocean, a pattern perhaps. 
- Strong conviction, strong dukkha
- The take away for designers. Depending on how you construct your view of what a human is will inform your design.

Declaration of faith?

I believe childrend are born who, perfect, pure. The trajectories of their lives are drawn perfectly by a bowsting made of starts, destined to return to wholeness and love. However due to the pain, shame and conditioning our world impedes their ability to fly true and return to that wholeness.

My life is a project in umasking who I think I am, who my parents, society, school and media told me I am, so I can fly true,\. If I can do this better than parents did before me then I'll be leveling up by ability to do the same for my children. I want this so that they can live a life in deep rememberance of theri wholeness. 

Children have superpowers but our social design crushes them out of them. Children are the key to the shackles created by the shortcomings of older generations. Without sustainable futures for them, there is no innovation or progress, no walking through the scientific orchard, or discovery of religious and mystical experience. They are the portal between this world and the future. So opening their creative aperture to manifest, is opening our collective imagination towards new worlds and new ways of being together.
