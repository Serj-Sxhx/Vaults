: Perennialist and Universal Curriculum Theorists believe that one should teach the things that one deems to be of everlasting importance to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics. The focus is primarily on teaching reasoning and wisdom rather than facts, the liberal arts rather than vocational training.

 perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based.
 
 Both philosophies are typically considered to be [teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher "Teacher")-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [progressivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_progressivism "Educational progressivism"). However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method "Socratic method"), which, if carried out as true dialogue, involves a balance between teacher activity and student activity, with the teacher promoting discussion.
