### Lit Note 

The alternative to dependence on schools is not the use of public resources for some new device which "makes" people learn; rather it is the creation of a new style of educational relationship between man and his environment. 72, Cp.6

"What kinds of things and people might learners want to be in
contact with in order to learn?"

4 Resource Lables for student's goals. Not the curriculum's goals. 

"Educational resources are usually labeled according to educators' curricular
goals. I propose to do the contrary, to label four different approaches which
enable the student to gain access to any educational resource which may help
him to define and achieve his own goals:

### Tool [[Access to Tools]]
1. Reference Services to Educational Objects-which facilitate access to
things or processes used for formal learning. Some of these things can be reserved for this purpose, stored in libraries, rental agencies, laboratories, and showrooms like museums and theaters; others can be in daily use in factories, airports, or on farms, but made available to students as apprentices or on off hours.

### Type: Skill Teacher [[xAPI Events & Record Store (5)]]
2. Skill Exchanges--which permit persons to list their skills, the conditions
under which they are willing to serve as models for others who want to learn
these skills, and the addresses at which they can be reached.

### Matchmaking
3. Peer-Matching--a communications network which permits persons to
describe the learning activity in which they wish to engage, in the hope of
finding a partner for the inquiry.

### Celebrity Teachers Directory Coaching [[xAPI Events & Record Store (5)]] + Type: Cohort, Coaching, Course, Workshop
4. Reference Services to Educators-at-Large--who can be listed in a
directory giving the addresses and self-descriptions of professionals,
paraprofessionals, and free-lancers, along with conditions of access to their services. Such educators, as we will see, could be chosen by polling or consulting their former clients.

### On Tool Access 
Formal learning requires special access to ordinary things, on the
one hand, or, on the other, easy and dependable access to special things made
for educational purposes. An example of the former is the special right to
operate or dismantle] a machine in a garage. An example of the latter is the
general right to use an abacus, a computer, a book, a botanical garden, or a
machine withdrawn from production and placed at the full disposal of students.

At present, attention is focused on the disparity between rich and poor
children in their access to things and in the manner in which they can learn
from them. OEO and other agencies, following this approach, concentrate on
equalizing chances, by trying to provide more educational equipment for the
poor. A more radical point of departure would be to recognize that in the city rich and poor alike are artificially kept away from most of the things that surround them. Children born into the age of plastics and efficiency experts must penetrate two barriers which obstruct their understanding: one built into things and the other around institutions. Industrial design creates a world of things.

### On Games at school 
Games are a case in point. I do not mean the "games" of the physical
education department (such as football and basketball), which the schools use to
raise income and prestige and in which they have made a substantial capital
investment. As the athletes themselves are well aware, these enterprises, which
take the form of warlike tournaments, have undermined the playfulness of
sports and are used to reinforce the competitive nature of schools. Rather I have
in mind the educational games which can provide a unique way to penetrate
formal systems. Set theory, linguistics, propositional logic, geometry, physics,
and even chemistry reveal themselves with little effort to certain persons who
play these games. A friend of mine went to a Mexican market with a game
called "'Wff 'n Proof," which consists of some dice on which twelve logical
symbols are imprinted. He showed children which two or three combinations
constituted a well-formed sentence, and inductively within the first hour some
onlookers also grasped the principle. Within a few hours of playfully
conducting formal logical proofs, some children are capable of introducing
others to the fundamental proofs of propositional logic. The others just walk
away.

In fact, for some children such games are a special form of liberating
education, since they heighten their awareness of the fact that formal systems
are built on changeable axioms and that conceptual operations have a gamelike
nature. They are also simple, cheap, and--to a large extent--can be organized by
the players themselves. Used outside the curriculum such games provide an
opportunity for identifying and developing unusual talent, while the school
psychologist will often identify those who have such talent as in danger of
becoming antisocial, sick, or unbalanckd. Within school, when used in the form
of tournaments, games are not only removed from the sphere of leisure; they
often become tools used to translate playfulness into competition, a lack of
abstract reasoning into a sign of inferiority. 

### Insisting on certification keeps skills scarce

Schools thus produce shortages of skilled persons. A good example is the
diminishing number of nurses in the United States, owing to the rapid increase
of four-year B.S. programs in nursing. Women from poorer families, who
would formerly have enrolled in a two- or three-year program, now stay out of
the nursing profession altogether.

Insisting on the certification of teachers is another way of keeping skills
scarce. If nurses were encouraged to train nurses, and if nurses were employed
on the basis of their proven skill at giving

injections, filling out charts, and giving medicine, there would soon be no
lack of trained nurses. Certification now tends to abridge the freedom of
education by converting the civil right to share one's knowledge into the
privilege of academic freedom, now conferred only on the employees of a
school. To guarantee access to an effective exchange of skills, we need
legislation which generalizes academic freedom.

The right to teach any skill should come under the protection of freedom of speech. Once restrictions on teaching are removed, they will quickly be removed from learning as well.

### Reimbursement for Skills Teachers 

The teacher of skills needs some inducement to grant his services to a
pupil. There are at least two simple ways to begin to channel public funds to noncertified teachers. One way would be to institutionalize the skill exchange by creating free skill centers open to the public. Such centers could and should be established in industrialized areas, at least for those skills which are
fundamental prerequisites for entering certain apprenticeships--such skills as
treading, typing, keeping accounts, foreign languages, computer programming
and number manipulation, reading special languages such as that of electrical
circuits, manipulation of certain machinery, etc. Another approach would be to
give certain groups within the population educational currency good for
attendance at skill centers where other clients would have to pay commercial
rates.

A much more radical approach would be to create a "bank" for skill
exchange. Each citizen would be given a basic credit with which to acquire
fundamental skills. Beyond that minimum, further credits would go to those
who earned them by teaching, whether they served as models in organized skill
centers or did so privately at home or on the playground. Only those who had
taught others for an equivalent amount of time would have a claim on the time
of more advanced teachers. An entirely new elite would be promoted, an elite
of those who earned their education by sharing it.

Should parents have the right to earn skill credit for their children? Since
such an arrangement would give further advantage to the privileged classes, it
might be offset by granting a larger credit to the underprivileged. The operation of a skill exchange would depend on the existence of agencies which would facilitate the
development of directory information and assure its free and inexpensive use.
Such an [[agency]] might also provide supplementary services of testing and
certification and might help to enforce the legislation required to break up and
prevent monopolistic practices.

Fundamentally, the freedom of a universal skill exchange must be
guaranteed by laws which permit discrimination only on the basis of tested
skills and not on the basis of educational pedigree. Such a guarantee inevitably
requires public control over tests which may be used to qualify persons for the
job market. Otherwise, it would be possible to surreptitiously reintroduce
complex batteries of tests at the work place itself which would serve for social
selection. Much could be done to make skill-testing objective, e.g., allowing
only the operation of specific machines or systems to be tested. Tests of typing
(measured according to speed, number of errors, and whether or not the typist
can work from dictation), operation of an accounting system or of a hydraulic
crane, driving, coding into COBOL, etc., can easily be made objective.

In fact, many of the true skills which are of practical importance can be so
tested. And for the purposes of manpower management a test of a current skill
level is much more useful than the information that twenty years ago a person
satisfied his teacher in a curriculum in which typing, stenography, and
accounting were taught. The very need for official skill-testing can, of course,
be questioned: I personally believe that freedom from undue hurt to a man's
reputation through labeling is better guaranteed by restricting than by
forbidding tests of competence.
