`Five Whys`

How would, you know that  

`Weekly reflection`
Did the things that I did that week actually move me closer to the goals.

`Resource Mapping (From disaster relief`
Share your projects 
List resources that you would need 
Look to the group if we have any of that.

`Dream Team's` - Dream team board.
- Imagine that you could get the ultimate person to help you with this 
- Why would they be such a great person to help you - Why are they on your dream team. 
- The group tries to get hold of that person.
- Or finds people that fit the criteria and make an introduction. 

e.g. Bach - Deep understanding of musical notes working + Good taste

Get your most up todate model

`Expand the field of vision`
Why - It primes the thing that you're most likely to neglect. 

- Take the position of how you don't like to think about this.
- Or the role that's least interesting to you about this project
- The group our alone try to imagine that you're only responsible for finances.
- What would that role / person would see as important.
- Do any of those things help you move forwards. 

`Double click`
Arrive with a summary of what they're working on.

e.g. I'm thinking about the best ways to ... X Y Z 

Everyone in the group writes down specifically what they would like to talk to that person about on a card 

e.g. I have 14 years in x let's explore this relationship between X & Y 

Schedule a time to do deeper with that person.
