Where are we? There's a revived sense of grassroots scholasticism. Aristotle, logic becomes dominant and science really advancing.

He's influenced by Bacon and his circle, Decartes, Galileo, Newton

1600s 



Comenius has two works which impact the intelectual scene.

1. The Great Didactic

2. His textbooks

Teaching literacy in analogy with teaching them orally by showing things then showing the word for them. 

Language should be learned by picture book and by generalist 
knowledge of everyday scenes that one might encounter. 

These are not arcane and ancient settings.

1. Ordered by by what you can see in front of you.
	- You start by what is first accessible to a learner's senses - very Baconian. 
	- How do you do history because history is not available to the senses? Systematically build a child's sense of time. 
	- How do you teach shapes? Comparison after knowing this is a square, this is a triangle, what's the difference? 


2. It's kind of weird to study law by studying the dystinion codes. Or logic by commentary on aristotle
	- What's going on with the field and present it to the child
	- what's an example? Newton comes along and see the world with gravity not Aristotle's sciences. Don't study newton like a work of the classics, how did newton figure this out? Comenius want's people to understand by scoping an sequencing contemporary knowledge.

He's still very religious

organise by what the child needs to understand or by the work

Augustine says memorise, then you understand it.
Comenius says start with accessible stuff, the lords prayer or interesting sermons. 

3. Content is the centre, orbus pictus is to impart knowledge. Principles of certain things and that you should know this content. 

### How should education be organised

![[Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 09.25.55.png]]

Strong analogy to Montessori 

How would you teach argument and logic? Children ask questions... give them vocabulary to the structure the process of their natural experience or questioning - Especially in Preschool. 

What is the mother's knee. 0-6 age. The carer or parent is the first form of education. Every single mother or nurse should learn how to do this publicly via training and a handbook. You need to teach people to know the vocabulary and how to notice what the children are noticing. 

The vernacular-school 6-12: Learn to read and write in your native tongue. Latin was not a native language at this time. Don't teach them the language of the elite just learn in the language of the vernacular.

The latin school or Gymnasium 12-18: The latin school should be like medieval university, more science, more latin, more entry status 

The university and travel: 

Odo fredus would gather students and stand and talk. The scholar would know things and students would take notes.

Picture a medical lecture hall with chairs raised above the scholar. Demonstrations so that student's should be able to learn by observation. 

Comenius wants people to observe scientific approaches, You can learn things by yourself through your senses.

It's not about temperance. it's about orienting you to god via knowledge.

We can't know all things in a lifetime. Not every teacher is fit for every student. How do we give them the tools to learn for themselves.

Comenius thinks 1 to 100 is possible teacher to students 

1 to 35 is good for preschool in Montessori.

Modernity is unlocking [[agency]] in the individual. 

A summary of Comenius

-   Education was a perfectible machine, you could have on mass education or one teacher teaches 100 students, the same thing at the same time you just have it so perfected you just have the perfect.
![[Screenshot 2022-03-22 at 13.58.32.png]]-   textbook and activity book and lab sequences like whatever you think should go into education some sort of combination of.
-   readings lectures and activities that everybody just moves through a perfectly in lockstep.
- And that this actually if you did it right would give you the knowledge of nature that ramped up the knowledge of religion and knowledge of God and was in some ways the same as or overlapped with with knowledge of God great communities and this preparing all souls for the afterlife.

### John Locke 1632-1704
Influenced by newton.

The main thesis of which

Locke's thoughts on education - Concerning education.

He was the tutor of a few children - it's very humble and starts from what he observes works with kids.

![[Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 09.52.01.png]]

- develop virtue by modeling and types of encouragement and socialisation. 
- When they're in the right cognitive mood for curiosity and what they're interested in - in the moment.
- Go into town and do trade, go do something. 
- Individualism: Different children are different

Serj note: The teacher should be an anthropologist [[seymore papert]]

It's natural to find your children cute. Most people treat kids like this, then they try to lay down the law and put restraints on them. 

When they're a baby, give them an impressions, when they develop reason, back off and treat them like a college. This is an attitude that you bring 

5-6 get into the habit of modeling reason for them.

Be a bit more authoritative when they're younger, a bit more collegial when they're older.

Learn current culture, develop a theory of history.

There's a whole element to learning which is about interest, 

Obligation to learning is antithetical to learning

It's not higher or lower, the son of a gentle men should go out, get a job an make something of themselves

Assumes that the teacher is inspirational and models virtue well. 


Take freedom, choice, and preferences seriously.
- get a job, do some practical arts.
