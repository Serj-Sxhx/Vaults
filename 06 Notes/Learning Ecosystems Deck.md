# The ordinary world

Personal computers, the internet and economic forces have caused an unprecedented shift in the shape of education. Despite having the world's knowledge at your fingertips, learning online and in person is far from optimal. Humanity's latent potential is being undermined.

Our civilization is facing many simultaneous crises: crises in climate, meaningful work and lives, economics, media, and political legitimacy. 

Interpenetrating and underpinning many of these is our educational crisis.

Educational demand is not being met by educational supply. Existing educational institutions are inadequate at adapting quick enough to meet new technological demands.

Educational systems, systems made of living changing and evolving people are autopoietic: They expend energy on the work of self-making.

As we define it, _education_ is central to the function by which a society of humans engages in self-creation, self-perpetuation, and self-sustainability.

All other social systems—from economics to infrastructure and government—depend upon the success of educational processes, insofar as all social systems depend upon people with requisite skill and motivation to fulfill essential tasks.

A crisis occurs when a complex system is unable to do the work of continuing to be itself. Take and extreme medical crises for example, in which the failure of a single organ puts the entire body in crisis because it can no longer perform basic metabolic processes.

Why is that a problem?

The requisite skills and ideas are not being passed on. Technology is evolving faster than our abilities to teach younger generations about it.

The problems that we face are becoming increasingly more complex, multi-polar and wicked. As we approach an uncertain future, education and learning will be required to draw from un-siloed, inter-disciplinary knowledge, thinking and methodologies.

 While things like universities will likely still be essential for training engineers, doctors, lawyers e.t.c much of learning is moving away from these institutions as they become unbundled by new business models and technologies. 

# Why now

Covid recovery will be difficult. new economic opportunities will be scarce and community support for re-skilling and wellbeing is informal but increasingly more common.

There's been a rise in educational supply with the rise of Bootcamps, MOOCs Cohort based Courses, Remote Tutoring, Informal online communities and Live streamers on Youtube. This nascent space of informal and self-directed learning has no formalized way of becoming legible to employers or other opportunities for further learning.

You can learn anything you want online for free but what's often overlooked is what families, local expertise, co working spaces, makerspaces, studios, community halls, libraries, can provide for young learners which lay outside of the blueprint of the education system.

However, access, legitimization and credentialing of these these educational learning objects, facilities, experiences and the skilled people is not currently well coordinated or surfaced to the learners who need them the most. 

Many universities and schools that did not secure substantial philanthropic investment or diversify funding during the pandemic are paying for large overheads on unused physical buildings and infrastructure. 

Coworking spaces face similar challenges and many local makerspaces and facilities will be looking for new opportunities to attract customers after the pandemic recedes.

Broadly there is a wavering faith in traditional education systems at large with huge spikes of increased movement to online schools such as Sora, Prisma, Galileoxp and other internet-native learning. 

What if we could tap into those underused heavy assets, talent and facilities and plant the infrastructure for change across the entire system. This will require looking at new lines of designing things away from changing how schools operate or creating single programmes within existing institutions.

> Diverse places for learning exist in every community, and corner of the internet, but the connective tissue making that learning legible does not.

## Solution

Two parts here: 

Part 1: xAPI 2.0 - Updating the existing xAPI and learning management system which records learning activities across devices and in person on a central ledger. https://xapi.com/overview/

Part 2: An Ecosystems approach to learning - A proposal for the cultural environment, pedagogy, curriculum and assessment that supports xAPI.

Together this forms a platform - It's function is to aggregate formal and informal educational providers, facilities, train new teachers then provide the learner with suggested paths via their dashboard map, given a learner's learning goals and outcomes.

## Part 1: xAPI 2.0

At it's core xAPI is a ledger that stores learning that happens in many places via an app, QR codes, a chrome extension and self reported information.

It's goal is to [[Provide a long chain of evidence of learning for stakeholders (14)]] based on the 4 levels of the Kirkpatric Model for assessing training effectiveness.

Attending events, time spent using facilities, completing projects, meeting tutors and coaches are all tracked using xAPI. 

![[LRS(Ledger) (1).png]]

The student decides what xAPI data to make visible on a [[Dynamic Portfolio (23)]] which they can edit and add more context to enabling them to find new learning opportunities, validate themselves as teachers on the network or apply for job opportunities.

## Part 2: The Platform for an ecosystems approach to learning.

>"Over the next century, scholars and fans aided by computational algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We'll come to understand that no work, no idea, stands truly alone, but that all good true and beautiful things are networks, ecosystems of intertwined parts, related entities and similar works" - **Kevin Kelly - Editor Wired Magazine**

I'd like you to come with me on a journey of the imagination, Suspend your disbelief for a moment as we collectively explore the already existing but poorly organized reality of the 'City As A school.'

![[City as a School.png]]

You can learn anything you want online for free but what's often overlooked is what families, local expertise, co working spaces, makerspaces, studios, community halls, libraries, can provide for young learners which lay outside of the blueprint of the education system.

All this learning is happening all the time, everywhere.

In the city as a school a projects or as we like to call them, [[Quests]], are made visible to the learner via a map on their smartphone dashboard. 

![[The Learning Portal.png]]

Quests are: place based, contextualized projects that demonstrate competency.

Some quests are submitted by local educators and other learners, 

More commonly they are designed by industry partners and formal education institutions in collaboration with the platform.

A set of quests contribute to skill paths that learners can take if their player style is employment. 

They take place in online if it's a purely digital and technical quest or they can be worked on at various categories of physical locations.

![[Ecosystems Elements (1).png]]

## The User Journey 

### 1) A learner logs in and looks at their learning portal

![[The Learning Portal 1.png]]

### 2) Selects their player type and learning goal:

- Reskill - For those looking for the quickest paths to employment.
- Achiever - For learners who want to go deep on a subject and complete many quests in a narrow domain.
- Explorer - For learners who want to find adjacent fields and learn many things that may or may not overlap following their curiosity.
- Social - For those who want to meet people with similar interests, hobbies and skills.


![[LRS(Ledger) (2).png]]

### 3) The app generates a content curriculum like [vivid](https://www.vivid.so/) + Curates Resources

It curates quests, skilled people and resources given the learner's goal and player style by reverse engineering the learning outcome.

**Outcome:** A curated list of resources, facilities, online courses, skills exchanges and locations that the learner can get started with towards their learning goal.

![[Long Chain of Evidence.png]]

### 4) The learner is assigned a [[Guide]] and meets them online or in person. 

Together they review and refine the learning goal and do complete the learning power profile [[Learning power]] together to see what kind of support this learner needs and to discover how confident they are in their ability to learn and adapt. This guide might connect them to a [[Learning Moai]], a peer support group, and decide on a [[Learning Moai Cadance (1)]] to meet regularly with them.

[[Learning power]] & [[Vcol + 7]] assessments are already market ready technologies.
https://www.linkedin.com/company/jearni/
https://jearni.co/
https://lecticalive.org/about/vcol#gsc.tab=0

**Outcome:** The learner should feel confident that they can find support, and access locations and resources that they need as they engage with the core game loop (Virtuous cycle of learning [[Vcol + 7]]) (Setting a learning goal, Seeking information, Applying knowledge and Reflecting)

![[Manager Dashboard.png]]

### 5) The learner depart into open world learning

![[The Learning Portal (1).png]]

### 6) Along the way and on public transport they explain new concepts to a GPT-__ chatbot at varying levels of complexity -  Conceptual / Propositional Knowledge Assessment

Aiming for being able to define concepts at multiple levels.
Their text that they input as definitions are stored in their concept log (part of xAPI data)

(Maybe some kind of coin/reward system for completion)

![[Measuring Understanding.png]]

### 6) Throughout the day their completed quests, attended events, content watched, time with facilities e.t.c is stored as xAPI Data - Procedural Knowledge Assessment

![[LRS(Ledger) (1) 1.png]]

### 7) Over time they make xAPI data visible via their Dynamic portfolios - Perspectival Knowledge Assessment

The portfolio creation process is fluid. 
Machine Learning clusters and groups similar data.

Users select what data to make visible and input more written context to their projects and reflect on what they learnt by attending certain events and content. 

They can then make multiple portfolios for different goals. 

They use this to write a short summary at the top of their portfolios where they can engage their situational awareness by connecting their knowledge to trends they see in the world and how their learning experiences could support the companies they're applying to. 

![[Measuring Understanding (1).png]]

**Outcome: ** A long chain of evidence for learning that a learner has reflected on. Valid information to make their outcomes, previous work, dedication and effort move transparent to employers or to earn as a learning provider on the platform.


Navigating all of this requires new forms of search, discovery, matchmaking, legitimization and accreditation.

### What 

Assment 

It does 3 things 

**1) Assessment **

Enables the learner to [[Provide a long chain of evidence of learning for stakeholders (14)]]. exAPI collects data of learning events such as completed projects, Guide meetings, content engagement, and facility usage.

The learner can then toggle the visibility of the event data that the desire in their [[Dynamic Portfolio (23)]], add some custom context so they can find new learning opportunities, validate themselves as teachers on the network or apply for job opportunities.  

**2) Discovery **

It connects verified educational suppliers with learner but offering the learner suggested discovery via the map on the learner dashboard. 

[[image of urban sports club]]

**3) Pedagogy** 

The core game loop we're focusing on is set seek apply reflect. We call this the viruous cycle of learning [[Vcol + 7]]

[V Col diagram]

Learners select from 4 player types which indicate to the network what kinds of resources and events should be curated for them. 

The player types are 

Employment

Achiever

Socialite

Explorer

- they then consult a [[Guild]] who helps them clarify that goal
- They're matched with a [[Learning Moai]] with a [[Learning Moai Cadance (1)]] that they can fit into their weekly schedule around other life commitments. 
- The [[Learning Moai]] provides accountability and they study together.
- At the end of each  the local presents what they've learnt in the [[Moai Teachback]] a form of community event where everyone gathers at the end of the month to present what they've learnt to their local community trying to explain it in varying levels for the mixed age group.


**4) Curriculum **

_Quests_ 

are projects designed by locals or by partner learning providers such as schools, employers and hubs.  The quest project aims to provide authentic practice for the learner and results in:
- An xAPI project that the learner can make visible on their [[Dynamic Portfolio (23)]]
- [[Provide a long chain of evidence of learning for stakeholders (14)]]

Quests are always followed via mandatory self assessment for the learner to reflect on how what they learn has impacted their life, work and other projects, 

THese post project behavioral survey reports results are linked to xAPI data of that project so that it can appear on the learner's [[Dynamic Portfolio (23)]].

_Core Curriculum_

There is a core optional curriculum available as self paced courses or is available as an ecology of practices and games that any learner can ask a [[Guide]] to facilitate for and with them. The goal of the core curriculum is to develop a person into life long self-directed learner. 

The intensive version of this course is the training that the [[Guides]] attend to become guides. [[Guides]] conference quarterly to improve the quality of the pedagogy, games and eachothers art of teaching.

- Learning How to learn [[Learning power]] & Meta-cognitive exercises
- Problem framing 
- Tool Making / Basics of Logic and computation
- Wisdom & overcoming perennial problems
- Idea to Reality Stack 
- Assisted introspection and augmented empathy.
- LXD and instruction design.

The hero has committed to his task, and enters the special world. Often he is met by a threshold guardian. 

### Downsides.

While there are many challenges ahead these movements are already happening. The cultural trends are in motion.

Challenges:

**Requires a social movement:** Tech must be viewed as a cultural object not purely technological one.

**Supporting the creation of Mircoschools**

**Transport**

**Security**

Notes on Platforms 

-   Platforms can’t **solve** all of their own problems. Extensibility helps fill niches without complicating the core product.
-   Today’s SaaS apps can’t exist in **isolation**. Users expect integrations. Hence the rise of Zapier, Integromat and **[Automate.io](https://trends.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5a0620ca3ebb8b31f0c94ed0d&id=64c3d5a905&e=f449baca90)**.
-   Platforms **attract and extract**. Low take rates and high affiliate commissions attract partners. Value is extracted once network effects are strong.


### Macro Problem Notes



Education is about a generalized renewal, regeneration, and repopulating of the social world. 

Indeed, in uncertain times the only skill that really matters is your ability to learn, unlearn and adapt. So how might we create the kinds of institutions that don't just teach, on occasion, critical thinking, sensitivity to nuance and complexity, non-linear problem solving. 

While it is the case that the unskilled must become skilled to meet the global challenges I also suspect that the way that we make skilled people legible to employers and to gain access to opportunity is overlooking the exact things that university credentials don't represent - Experience.

University degrees are a strong signals of things like dedication, compliance and sustained intellectual pursuit. 

They'll remain necessary for job environments that demand such traits as medicine, law, and forms of research. 

But the vast majority of university degrees are BS and don't accurately reflect competence nor many of those traits that many employers now day seek out. 

---

While educational tracks from A to B are necessary, they are not sufficient
When we design A to B educational processes, we create A to B types of people.

I add to André Gorez's observation "Working is  (education systems are) not just the creation of economic wealth; it is also always a means of self-creation. Therefore we must also inquire into whether the contents and processes of the work (education systems) produces the kind of men and women we wish humanity to be made of.”

If you ask the same question of our current learning institutions are we creating the kinds humans what we wish humanity to be made of? 

Their role in society has primarily been a series of daycares and lecture halls that one goes through to find their place in the labour market.  Only a slice of those roles in the labour market require critical thinking and complex problem solving.

The problems that we face are becoming increasingly more complex, multi-polar and wicked.  As we approach an uncertain future, we are required to draw from un-siloed, inter-disciplinary knowledge, thinking and methodologies.  


Underlying the patchwork collage of what we've been talking about as 21st century skills is the notion of resilient self leadership. The ability to know myself as an agent who participates and accurately senses my environment to set goals by evaluating my purpose. 

It's extremely difficult to adopt this sense of self and develop this form of identity is not one that's readily handed to us in structures of formal education. 

Rather for about 18 years children are largely born into powerlessness and raided by the mercy of the two and increasingly just one human(s) ineffective and socially nuclear structure

{{Berger shows, the ordinary nuclear family was able to adapt superbly to changing economic and political realities}}(https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-family/)

As historian Niall Ferguson writes in his book 'The Tower and Square', "You have to fight networks, with networks."

Covid-19 stirred 125 years of educational stagnation from it's slumber. With schools no longer able to operate as usual, innovators and designers were forced to explore new pathways for designing the way we learn.

Invention due to necessity made it possible for learners to engage with local wisdom and expertise. (Something)
