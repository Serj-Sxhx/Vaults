**Learning power** 
: Learning power is the form of intelligence possessed by someone who, to quote Piaget "â€¦knows what to do when they don't know what to do." or as Ernest Hemingway called it,  'grace under pressure', the ability to stay intelligent when things get tricky, frustrating or difficult.

The concept emerged during the 1980s and 90s, in the writings of the [cognitive scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_scientist "Cognitive scientist") [[Guy Claxton]]
