-   What do you do with 15 year olds problem.
    
-   So high school is pretty new.
    
-   Historically, like as like there's this thing that you do after primary school, but before college and most people do, and the fact that, like you know.
    
-   Like 95% of people do high school today is extremely new that used to be what when high school emerged, it was as some sort of systematized college preparatory thing, but this problem goes back to.
    
-   goes back to antiquity were like yeah like as an adult you're going to like participant in political life, maybe you'll study rhetoric, maybe like that there's a bunch of different things if you'll do a military commanders a bunch of things now on your.
    
-  But that's when your education is finished So what do you do, do you like send your kids to get extra military training during this time it's just this kind of awkward period between.
    
-  When you're really ready for studying or doing higher things and and when you when you graduated what we would now today call middle school.
    
-  And I mean the modern solution to that is high school, but it is like it's just again worth pausing on like to kind of awkward problem like should you.
    
- Should you be in school like you're ready for some things are not ready for other things and it's just like it's always been one of the more contentious areas of education, or one last figured out areas of education, because it's very hard to standardize.
    
- 15 year olds are 16 year old seven year olds are very different in terms of their needs and trajectories and Okay, if you acknowledge those differences are you tracking them.
    
- Like in an authoritarian way if you don't acknowledge them or you just like having everybody learned a bunch of crap that most people aren't going to need like it's a difficult problem.
