: _Agency _simply means “the quality of being capable of taking action”. You and the people around you seem to have agency; while rocks generally do not. Inanimate objects are sometimes granted agency in a kind of humorous quote marks (eg “the washer decided to break today”); Agents _(entities that have agency) have_ goals _or_ purposes_, and the actions they take are seen as being in pursuit of these goals. Agency thus implies some rudimentary_ rationality_, and a degree of _autonomy_.


A better distinction for me is going from a simple controller to an agent and I try to because we are very

1:23:47

good at discovering agency in the world what does it actually mean when we discover agency and when we discover our

1:23:53

own agency and start to amplify it um by making models of who we are and how

1:23:59

we deal with the world and with others and so on the minimal definition of agent that I found it's a controller for

1:24:04

future States the thermostat doesn't have a goal by itself right it just has a Target value

1:24:11

and a sensor that tells the deviation from the target value and when that exceeds a certain threshold the heating

1:24:18

is turned on and if it goes below a certain threshold the heating is turned off again and this is it so the

1:24:24

thermostat is not an age and it only reacts to the present frame it's only a reactive system

1:24:30

whereas an agent is proactive which means that it's trying to um not just

1:24:36

minimize the current deviation from the target value but the integral over at

1:24:41

the time span previously the future deviation so it builds an expectation about how uh an action is going to

1:24:49

change this trajectory of the universe and over that trajectory it tries to figure out some measure of how big the

1:24:57

compound Target deviation is going to be and so as a result you get a branching universe and the branches in this

1:25:03

universe some of these branches depend on actions that are available to you and that translate into decisions that you

1:25:09

can make that uh move you into more or less preferable wealth States and

1:25:15

suddenly you have a system with emergent beliefs desires and intentions but to make that happen to move from a

1:25:22

controller to agency and agent has been a controller with an integrated setpoint

1:25:27

generator and the ability to control future states that requires that you can

1:25:33

make models that are counterfactual so because the future universe doesn't

1:25:38

exist right now you need to create a counterfactual universe The Future model of the future Universe maybe even a

1:25:45

model of the past universe that allows you to reason about possible for future universes and so on and to make these

1:25:50

counter factual causal models of the universe you need to have a turing machine

1:25:55

so without a computer without something that is too incomplete that insulates you from the causal structure of your

1:26:02

substrate that allows you to build representations regardless of what the universe says right now around you right

1:26:09

you need to have that machine and the simplest uh system in nature that has turing machine integrated is the cell

1:26:17

so uh it's very difficult to find a system in nature that is an agent that

1:26:22

is not made from cells as a result maybe there are systems in nature that are able to uh compute things and make

1:26:29

models but uh I I'm not aware of any so the simplest one that I know that can do

1:26:35

this reliably is the cells or arrangement of sets and that can possess

1:26:41

agency which is interesting thing that explains this coincidence that living

1:26:46

things are agents and vice versa that the agent that we discover are mostly living things or there are robots that

1:26:53

have computers built into them or uh virtual robots that have that rely on

1:26:59

computation so the ability to make models of the future is the prerequisite for agency and to make arbitrary models

1:27:06

which means structures that embody uh causal uh simulations of some sort that
