# Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Training Evaluation Model - Analyzing Training Effectiveness
-   The four levels are:
-   Reaction.
-   Learning
-   Behavior
-   Results.

## Level 1: Reaction
-   This level measures how your trainees (the people being trained), reacted to the training. Obviously, you want them to feel that the training was a valuable experience, and you want them to **feel good about the instructor, the topic, the material, its presentation, and the venue.**
-   
## Level 2: Learning
-   At level 2, you measure **what your trainees have learned**. How much has their knowledge increased as a result of the training?
-   When you planned the training session, you hopefully started with a list of **specific learning objectives**: these should be the starting point for your measurement. Keep in mind that you can measure learning in different ways depending on these objectives, and depending on whether you're interested in changes to knowledge, skills, or attitude.
-   At this level, you evaluate **how far your trainees have changed their behavior,** based on the training they received. Specifically, this looks at how trainees apply the information.
-
-   Level 4: Results. At this level, you **analyze the final results of your training**. This includes **outcomes** that you or your organization have determined to be good for business, good for the employees, or good for the bottom line.
