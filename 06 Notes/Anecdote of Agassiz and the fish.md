_No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish:_

_A post-graduate student equipped with honours and diplomas went to Agassiz to receive the final and finishing touches._

_The great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it._

_Post-Graduate Student: “That’s only a sun-fish”_

_Agassiz: “I know that. Write a description of it.”_

_After a few minutes the student returned with the description of the Ichthus Heliodiplodokus, or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of Heliichterinkus, etc., as found in textbooks of the subject._

_Agassiz again told the student to describe the fish._

_The student produced a four-page essay._

_Agassiz then told him to look at the fish._

**_At the end of the three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it._**
