# What are we becoming?

Essential and unique to human nature is our depth of nurture capacity relative to other species. Homosapiens put the largest investment into our young. We delay reproductive maturity for 12 times around the sun and are vulnerable for years compared to the wilder beast which is more or less ready to go from birth. This long period of development provides us with an unparalleled opportunity for teaching, adaptation, development and knowledge transfer.
