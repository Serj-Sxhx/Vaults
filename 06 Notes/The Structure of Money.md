If you can only describe something's function without being able to describe it's structure, you're in a realm of vagueness where meaning can collapse

How money's structure is concealed by it's 'functions'

Structure precedes function 

form follows function

It's easy to see how a chair holds you up by looking at it's full structure, but not very easy to see how money holds an economy up by looking at it's structure.

The structure is large. Why is it difficult to draw the structure. 1) Human scale minds find it hard to see such scale and we are immersed in it. 2) Where does a person who is struggling to see the structure of money turn to for help?

Textbooks of standard economics specialize in drawing our attention away from the structure of money, by focusing it instead upon vague functions of money, to the point where many people seem to believe that the latter is the former 

Those who studied at a university quote the economics mantra of  'Money is a store of Value, medium of exchange, and unit of account'

These are all secondary properties that emerge from a primary structures. 

Textbooks indirectly describe money through a tick-box exercise: Rather than saying "here is the structure of money. it does A, B, and C" they say "Anything that does A, B and C is money". It is a way of eluding to the structure without ever naming it. A bit like describing a chair as 'anything that enables you to sit on it, and also stand on it'

Money is not just beliefs in it's reality 
or the central banks conning you

Okay so the mission of drawing the structure 

1. When money is uttered, a clear and full structure image appears
2. we do not need to agree on exactly what it looks like but we need to agree that is should be foregrounded.
3. **We need to make a clear distinction between the individual experience of money** - the feeling of using tokens at a street level - and the hidden structure which transcend that. There is the phenomenological realm of money which can differ from it's structure.
