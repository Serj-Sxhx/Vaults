A theory of moral development and identity formation where as an agent relates to their environment they have to make choices between different social games that they'll participate in and move between. - Based off of work by Ruth Chang on hard choices, and Joe Edelman my friend and former employer at Human systems.

Many people are trying to impose scientific comparisons into moral choices. 

Where a scientific comparison can only be three outcomes: =, <, >. 

This isn't how moral choices work. In reality, when you have options (for example: yoga class vs. music lesson vs gymnastics) you can construct infinitely many lines of reasoning to justify your choice. 

This begs the question: what do you let guide your attention in these moments of choice. 

I would say it's your values. 

What is a value: a value is an attentional policy -- something which an agent can remind themselves of or bring to bear on the choice, which helps them to focus their attention on what they find meaningful.

Where attending to those things would reduce the regret in a choice and increase time well spent, 

Time well spent: is defined as the percentage of time spent living by your values vs. living in regretful choices. 

Expressive pedagogy tries to maximize time well spent for children and adolescents by helping them to understand their values as they navigate the sea of choices and overtime develop their moral and behavioral character by refining a continually acting inline with their values.

A current blocker in this is the limited number of social games a child can participate in at a school. Not only are 

They neither have agency to reflect on their values, nor bring them to bear on the limited number of social games at a school. It's often only in extracurricular activities or social games outside of school that children discover anything of moral value to them, because unfortunately many of them internalize the norms of school, and carry these with them forever more into the future and into the workplace. They never individuate from these norms. To remedy this, exposing children to an intentional array of social games and giving them an ample time to reflect on their values as they explore those social games would help children develop morally and increase their time well spent. Why Expressive Pedagogy? - The device should help someone discover their values (a meta-value [or virtue?] of reflection). Authentic Choice: - It's easy to mistake someone's choices and self-proclaimed values as values, but they're often polluted with internalized norms (things like professionalism, punctuality, obedience). - We have practices to decouple authentic values from internalized social norms, see: On My Own Terms, Transition Stories, Meaningless Time Journaling, Guessing Game, Emotions to Values, Field Tripping


### Identity

_“There are goals other than well-being, and values other than goals.”_ - Amartya Sen, 1984

One of the trickiest sources of regret is when we made a choice based on ill-informed values or goals. For instance, we have all made choices based on price where later we wished we had considered another factor as more important. Or sometimes we make purchases based on the mistaken idea that we will continue with a certain project.

This happens all the time. Perhaps a goal was overly specific, was dependent on some other goal in a way we didn‘t understand, was founded on a misunderstanding, or was just less compelling than a goal or value we hadn’t thought of yet.

In this map, an arrow is drawn when people tend to migrate from one activity to another activity, and the latter activity is reported to satisfy their desires more effectively.

**In which situations do our values shift in this way? And how can we make sure that users remain in charge of their own values, rather than having them directed by the device?** As philosopher Ruth Chang has argued, it seems likely that we define and adjust our values while making choices. Specifically, **we evolve our values when we have an initial difficulty making a choice because one option seems better in some ways, and another better in a different way**. Dr. Chang suggests✱ ✱ It would be good to have better data about these moments of value reconsideration.

**these are the moments where we reexamine and change our values, and that we often choose _a new, more general value_ for ourselves that makes the choice more clear.**

_**Inspiration plays a part here - Who do I want to become.**_

If this is correct, **we need a name for the environments in which this activity of self-construction can proceed fluidly. We will call these environments of expressive choice. To make an expressive choice, users must be able to explore a space of values that might apply to the choice, and to organize the options in front of them in terms of whatever they decide matters to them. As simple a thing as providing widgets for changing the sort order and filtering of options creates more possibility for expressive choice.**

**If menus are to help us find decisions we won‘t regret, they must allow us to explore what’s important to us about the options, and to navigate according to what we've decided is important.**
