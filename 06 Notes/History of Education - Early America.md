Your fundemental model should be treating each child as a little genius 

Where are we

- Comenius
- Locke
- Rousseau
- Dewey
- Montessori


Rousseau has reasons that women's education shouldn't be educated until didactically processes with their married husband.

Plato was egalitarian

Women of elite society have access to tutors so come out of no where, contibute heavily to scholar or state 

Education 
- Become individualised
- Become based first on the sensory capacity of a child 
- Include non-didactic, '"experiential"' moral education.

Jasonian democracy - You give every white man above 21 a vote. This is different to birthright and land. 

Who the hell are these 21 year olds. What is going to happen if we give these people political power? What's their level of competence?

Do you need to work to produce citizens of a certain competence? What role does a systematic education have in that? 

There's no school but there's high literacy rates. They're reading politically charged newspapers which are being distributed. Wide spread intellectualism in the culture. Debate is changing from a gentleman's monopoly to a "civil rhetoric"

If waves of people are coming from different cultures, what do you need to know to be here? What should be in the general education? 

What's good to know when it's a frontier and unstable violence from place to place and frontier to frontier.

Do we need a common culture?
What competencies are needed to participate in Civic life and vote? 

What role could education play in forming this?

Civics & Voting - There was an emergent canon for American content. Jefferson, Bible.

Remanent of European education in New England.

### Education is happening in a shack
- Blab school, drills say it out loud.
- It's the record repeating, It's a better Hellenistic period. This is basically the trivium updated for the American context. 
- Schooling is brief for frontier teachers.
- Teachers were wizards who sporadically appeared by nomads who were educated, probably from europe. 
- McGuffey reader - Demand driven textbooks from the 1830s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGuffey_Readers. McGuffey was a educator who surveyed practices and codified them. 1980s are still not politically correct, it's old fashioned. They're pretty good compared to what else was out there. It's not supernaturalist which is important in a more secularised world. Market dynamics drove the updating of the Text books and greatly increased the quality. These are teacher editions, and teacher trainings. 
- This is nothing that Locke or Rousseau recommended.
- People start at 8. Age doesn't emerge until the Prussian system.
- What about the quadrivium? It's an unrealised ideal. Maths is very practical and not from school. Maybe you're doing basic maths. Constructive geometry might be in the elite. Harmonics or astronomy just aren't studied.

### What's inside
- no maths in the readers.

### Higher education

- Harvard was a divinity school. Latin was to get in via the exam, they used latin to study theology. 
- In Europe the highest thing to do was to contribute to scholarly research
- In America, the highest target was politics. History, oratory strength.
- There was a suspicion of specialisation. There was something un-selfreliant about it. Electives were kind of weird.

### What's happening in New England

1600 everyone has to be literate to read the bible.

- First Schools funded by communities, Then Driven by tax dollars
- It's still high status to learn latin which is why the first public school is Boston Latin
- Gradually growing interest in what is happening in Europe science.
- They're operated publicly by what is the administrative structure.

Antioch collage - Horace Mann

	- English system is criticised due to industrial conditions
	-

### What is not driving education in the U.S.

- Industilistion is not driving education in the US
- It's not driving reforms in the collages. 
- More driven by national character and civic participation.
