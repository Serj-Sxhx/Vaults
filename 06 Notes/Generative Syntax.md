Chomsky developed an analytical tool known as generative syntax,

which represents the order of words in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees

that show what structures are possible.

Based on this tree, we could suggest a grammar rule

that adverbs must occur in verb phrases.

But with more data, it quickly becomes clear

that adverbs can appear outside of verb phrases.

This simplified example illustrates a major problem:

it takes a lot of data from each individual language

to establish the rules for that language,

before we can even begin to determine

which rules all languages might have in common.
