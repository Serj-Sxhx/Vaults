: Seeing connections, making meaning and relating new learning to what matters to me; the opposite is fragmentation and confusion.

1) Activating mental models, to turn chaos into order.
2) know the implications of certain knowledge in and across contexts
3) and can explain something in multiple ways.

## What are the key dimensions of X?

## What are observable behaviours that might indicate if someone is X?

## What values guide attention when someone is X?

## What are the hard steps of Sense-Making 

### Solo Sense making
**Personal Information layer**

Understanding
 **Activating mental models, to turn chaos into order.**
 -	Remembering my desired learning outcomes.
 -	Noticing contradictions between my world model and new information.
 -	Gathering information that is related to my learning objective, desired outcome or curiosity 
 **know the implications of certain knowledge in and across contexts**
 -	Foreseeing the consequences of my propositions, skills, perspectives on other contexts 
  **Can explain something in multiple ways.**
  -	Noticing patters of similarity between contexts 


**Systems Perspective **
-	Noticing all the different elements, parts or concepts.
-	Noticing the different connections between elements, parts or concepts
-	Noticing the direction or magnitudes of the effects of one element to the other.
-	Identifying and then Keeping in mind the different levels 
-	Scanning for gaps in the levels of analysis. 
-	Identifying the effects of each level on the other.
-	Selecting different level of analysis
-	Noticing the interactions across levels. 
-	Keeping in mind a meta-framework while searching for new information. 
-	Switching between the phenomenological and theoretical mode of thinking.

- Changing context & testing propositions, skills and perspectives
- Accepting when an idea, theory or proposition is not supported by evidence. (Intellectual Humility)

**Social Emotional**
- Remembering / Keeping in mind the social and historical context that the information is coming from.
- Noticing my and other's biases
- Staying in touch with the intention of the person who's sharing the information and no juts the proposition, idea or theory.
- Holding multiple truths

## Games
#roleplay 

### Participatory to procedural 
- every body watches the master(s) and individually writes an instructions list of the step by step actions that they took to complete the skill. 
- Once everyone has a list of steps they circle into a group to synthesis a complete list of instructions and find gaps. 
-  
- The master follows the instructions and let's the process breakdown if they missed something. 
- 
- Individual make 
- if it's missing stuff then the master is 

### Roleplays Perspect Participatory Knowing. 
-Take what you're learning about, 
- Anthropomorphise it 
- e.g. if I'm learning about chemicals I should improv how to be chemicals. 
- Take on the perspective of hydrogen. 
- e.g. If it's banking, what would it be it be the debts, what would it

### Perspectival - Say it how you see it
- Take on a element of the system and talk to the group about the way that you see the world. 
- Explain who you are in terms of a superhero.
- You can't use the word or name that you are.
	- Teacher makes a list of the 5 most common words associated with that element of the system
- Talk about banking.
- List of words you're not allowed to use the word debt

### Apply the concept to something where you think it won't obtain - Metaphor game 
- Easy version (Worked out, the teacher helps you discuver), teachers give you two related fields and they can validate the connection. 
- Teachers can remove points when your metaphor does not map. 
- Medium - The quizzed get's (whatever you care about you get to pick what domain the you explain it in terms of) 
	- Idea - Explain the world of warcraft to set it up. 
	- Idea - Pick 3 domains and get the crowd to put their hands up
	- Idea - The crowd ranks if that analogy is helpful, if they understand it, 
	- idea.- Students can vote if it was funny, useful, or accurate 
		- Idea - a further round of sense making to fix a metaphor that lost a point because it was, e.g. How is currency is like a duck 
	
- Celestial orbits, to st.patrics  day. 
	- More examples Economics is like ____ because 
		- **Fun **
		- Farm Animals 
		- Cities 
		- Car
		- **Syntonistic** 
		- Human Body
		- A profession (Dentists, High school) 
			- Relationships 
			- Desires 
			- Needs 
			- Visions and goals
			- Pains and struggles 
			- Writes of passage
		- The cultural context that we're all in (As Americans in 2020)
			- 
- Explain one domain through the language of another domain.
- Explain celestial orbits in terms of underwater fish. 
- Assign eachother the domain that you believe that they couldn't explain it form 
	- Explain particle physics in terms of laundry day
		- A round of research and concept mapping prep. . 

### Propositional to Procedural Common problems Quiz show. (Long Setup) Fix the Fact.
Teacher provides - List of all propositions
Quiz group comes up with statements, propositions or facts
they distort them and. makes some to be not true.
the quizzed group tries to fix them 
> Find the right proposition after being presented a faulty setup. 
> I identify the wrong propositions.  
-	 Teacher thinks of something that people could be miss conceiving
-	 Students have to think about that what the misconception. 
-	 Find which is slightly wrong and why. 

### Procedural Director
#Toomuchcreativity
- Teachers give directions of interactions in the wrong way 
- The director has to fix it to make it work. 
- The group knows the working way and wont let it happen. 
- 
- Everybody gets give instructions of what they do but don't know what they are 
- The director has to get them to the end state by instructing the people on what to do. 

### Origin / Status quo game. Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)
- How they were used to serve a power structure 
- find a way that the thing we're studying or concept we are studying was used horribly or inhumanely. What would you have to keep in mind to have not done that. 
	- Find different things that it's been used for 
	- Ways that we could have avoided that. 
	- Can and shoulds.
