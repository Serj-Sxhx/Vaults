### Step 1: Reflect on challenging aspects of the situation
-   Logistics and Resources I need
    -   The (right) equipment (to) remember, identity, find, arrange, collect, build, borrow ❓Do you need a special kind of equipment? What’s hard to do about knowing what you need or getting those things?
    -   The (right) people (to) identify, gather, select, find, get on board, convince, build relationships with ❓Does this value require a specific person? If so, what’s hard to do about gathering people who fit the criteria? What’s hard to do about knowing where to find them? What kind of information would you need to tell if someone is right? What’s hard to do about gathering that information? ❓What would you need to set up long in advance?
    -   The (right) time and timing (to) identify, notice, make, schedule ❓Does the moment need to be right? What would you need to be able to tell if the moment is right? What’s hard to do about evaluating that?
    -   The (right) setting (to) imagine, find, identify, set up, make, negotiate, decorate ❓Is this value easier in a specific setting? If so, what’s hard to do about creating that setting? ❓Do you need a certain mood or situation? If so, what’s hard to do about setting that mood / getting into that situation?
-   People: me, the other, the audience
    -   Current capacity and needs (physical, intellectual, emotional) (to) Assess, bolster, provide support, keep in mind, make space for, listen to, ask about ❓ What do you need to be capable of handling as it unfolds? What is hard to do about that?
    -   Skills, ability (to) Assess, bolster, practice, grow, accommodate, keep in mind
    -   Current mood/emotions (to) Assess, make space for, acknowledge, change plans for, improvise, change gears, model, foresee, track, keep in mind ❓What do you need to be able to **feel**? What’s hard to do about that? What’s hard to do about knowing when you’re ready to handle and feel those things? ❓Do you need a certain **mood**? What’s hard to do about setting that mood? ❓Does this value require a person to be in a **specific state**? If so, what’s hard to do about getting people into that state? What kind of information would you need in order to tell if someone is in the right state? What’s hard to do about gathering that info? Is the state you/they need to be in fragile? What’s hard to do about getting yourself/others there?
    -   Limiting beliefs (to) notice, identify, name, process, make time for, sit with, keep in mind, not get drawn into
-   Relationship: with myself, the other, the audience
    -   Sense of safety, trust (to) Assess, reassure, call to mind, remember, remind, provide support, keep in mind, ask about ❓Are there reasons it might be unsafe to do this? What kind of information do you need to decide? What’s hard to do about figuring out whether it’s safe in this particular situation?
    -   How might they see and understand me (to) model, assess, step into their shoes, remember, ask about, listen to, adjust course
    -   Status, Relationship Durability, Communication, Willingness to cooperate (to) assess, take into account, change, remember, remind, track over time, change, ignore, make space for, address
-   Consequences living by this value might have (to) assess, accept, sit with, make space for, hear out, mitigate, prepare for, remember, change, ignore


### Step 2: Action Verbs 🦸🏽‍♂️🦹🏻‍♀️

That fourth one, writing an instruction that could be followed, is usually most challenging. That is where the second Cheat Sheet comes into play. When I find myself unsure how to break a single action that is not sufficiently instructive to act on into several more specific actions, I look at this list of verbs:

-   **Noticing**—Noticing an internal or external stimulus, Attending to something, Tracking something.
-   **Feeling**—Noticing, Identifying the emotion, Disentangling the immediate cause and associated beliefs.
-   **Focusing**—Noticing, Selecting what to focus on, Attending to Something, Shifting focus, Tracking something over time, Keeping in mind, Staying in Touch with, Not getting distracted.
-   **Recognizing, Identifying**—Noticing an internal or external stimulus, Having a Referent (e.g. previous experience with the thing I am trying to identify)
-   **Gathering information, Finding out**—Discovering, Investigating, Scanning for—Knowing what you need (to know, to look out for), Gaining access, Interpreting what you learn.
-   **Remembering, Recalling**—Remembering how to do something or explicit knowledge, Having gained that knowledge, Remembering to remember.
-   **Generating, imagining alternatives** (creativity)
-   **Assessing, discerning**—Assessing, Evaluating, Discerning, Telling whether, Separating, Identifying.
-   **Deciding, Weighing, Choosing**—Trading off, Prioritising, Balancing more than one concern, Choosing the best ... (team, time, space)
-   **Modeling, Foreseeing**—Modeling interactions, Stepping into the shoes of the other, Foreseeing consequences, Anticipating.
-   **Changing Situations and Games**—Making space for, Creating, Getting, Finding, Arranging, Collecting, Building, Borrowing, Asking for support with, Pausing, Rearranging
-   **Social Skills**—Negotiating, Listening, Asking, Understanding, Reminding, Providing support, Stepping into their shoes, Empathy
-   **Resources, Capacity, Experience**—Setting yourself up ahead of time to do hard things later.
-   **Changing Course, Dealing with Setbacks**—Accepting, Sitting with, Bearing, Knowing it's okay, Improvising, Stepping back, Aborting, Changing mental model, gear, lens.

## **Step 3: Screen and Improve**

You have a massive list of possible hard steps. Yay! Now it's time to doublecheck and polish them. I usually go through my list of hard steps and try to figure out how each one could be better:

-   \[ \] Is it necessary for living by the value? (i.e. if you could never do this, could you not live by the value?) If it is **not really necessary** to live by this value, kick it out.

Ask
- [ ]  **Is it hard? **
(at least for some people, some of the time)
If it is **not really hard** (for some people, some of the time), kick it out. 
If you are not sure, ask yourself: "What is it that is hard about this?"
- [ ]  **Is it general enough to apply across cases?**
(e.g. a classroom, a hospital, a chatroom; lover, friend, parent)
If it is **so specific** that it does not apply across circumstances, kick it out. 
Which action IS hard to take across cases?
- [ ]  **Is it an instruction that could be followed?** 
(i.e., an action, that the person living by the value can take themselves?)
Often, potential hard steps are states or collection of actions or dependent on others.
Could you act this out right away? If not, make it way more specific. Add steps and detail.
