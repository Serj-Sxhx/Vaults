Herodotus, Histories 6.27.2 

>At about this same time, a little before the sea-fight, the roof fell in on boys learning their letters: of one hundred and twenty of them one alone escaped.

*It indicates a quantity of instruction in literacy far greater than we might have otherwise expected. In other words, by the beginning of the 5th Century many Greeks were learning to read and learning in schools.


Pindar Olympian 9.100-104 

> That which is innate is altogether greatest; but many men strive to win glory with excellence that are learned. Anything in which a god has no part is none the worse for being quelled in silence. For some roads go farther than others, and none will nourish us all. Wisdoms are high aloft...

*it is pointed out that achieving excellences is a long and difficult road and that none meets all needs, perhaps implying another reason why god-given excellence is superior to individual, learned skills


Iliad 11.828-32 

*This plea for healing is extended to Patrocles, Achilles’ companion. Patrocles has learned the healing arts from Achilles who learned them in turn from Chiron, the famous tutor of heroes and “most civilized of centaurs”. Medicine—including the ability to treat battle wounds, set bones, and use healing herbs—is one of the expertises recognized in the Homeric poems. Like other expertises, it is expected to be learned through tutelage, i.e.

*this quote also suggests another key Greek assumption about expertise and skill acquisition: experts are expected to be able to teach their art. In general, the Greeks assumed that an expert in X could make others become experts in X, or that knowledge could be transmitted from one person to their associates through a process of teaching. In fact, if a person could not parlay their knowledge to someone else, the Greeks would be skeptical if they had expert knowledge at all. 

Xenophanes DK B10 

> Since all from the beginning have learned from Homer.

*This text speaks directly to the centrality of Homer in Greek culture as early as the mid 6th c. BCE. Xenophanes is a mid-late 6th century BCE poet and philosopher. He is also a relentless critic of Homer and Hesiod, especially in regard to their depiction of the gods. 
*Xenophanes believes that the immoral and anthropomorphic depiction of the gods—and the many tales of monsters and the like—are utterly baseless and bad for their listeners. However, he believes that all of Greece has absorbed its worldview (including the nature of the gods) from Homer. Thus Homer is responsible for the mistaken views of the Greeks and his enduring popularity and centrality stands in the way of their reformation.

Pericles’ Funeral Oration 

*The most famous line in the one of most famous speeches in all of antiquity, Thucydides has Pericles claim in his funeral oration (for the Athenian war casualties) that 

> “the whole city” of Athens “is the teacher of Greece”. 

*Here, Thucydides’ Pericles is rhetorically seizing the mantle of Greek leadership from Sparta, even as Athens’ empire was battling Sparta and her allies for dominance of Hellas. For, previously, Sparta was sometimes thought of as the teacher of Greece.*

*The term for “teacher” is paideusis, which can equally mean “education” or even “school”, and the implication is that the city of Athens is an example for the rest of Greece. This is somewhat distinct from the idea that the city itself is a teacher to its citizens, but not entirely unrelated, as Athens had to instill a certain character into her citizens in order to achieve greatness and overcome all adversities.

*For our purposes, what is most relevant is the notion of teaching or education. If one preeminent city can be the “teacher” of Greece, it implies a common notion among the Greeks: moral education is often performed by exemplars.

Simonides fr. 90 West 

>The Polis teaches a man.

*To say that the city-state teaches a man is to claim that life within a city-state contributed to the character and development of its citizens.*


*How did the polis itself educate its citizens without a specific mechanism of schooling? By custom and law (nomos being the word for both). The customs and laws of the city-state, in contrast to some primitive apolitical mode of being, such as practiced by the bestial cyclops in the Odyssey, would teach a person how to behave and shape a person into something worthy of the name ‘human’.* **Content**

*In the best cities, the laws and customs would condition a person best and produce the most excellent or virtuous citizens. Hence, the polis “teaches” a man. Some cities, such as Sparta, which had more rigorous, public institutions for training and/or educating the young, often received praise from intellectuals for more intentionally “teaching” their men. 

*Then again, several philosophers doubted that cities were actually any good at moral education, and questioned whether and how a polis could manage to infuse virtue into citizens-to-be when their adult citizens lacked excellence and the knowledge and means of inculcating excellence in others.

Theognis Elegies 27-38

> It's easier to get and raise a child Than to put character in him. No one Has ever found a way to make a fool Wise or a bad man good. If god had given the sons of Asclepius [this] power… How many and large the fees they would earn

*the author advises his friend Cyrnus that by associating socially with other good men one can learn to be good, but that associations with the bad will spoil one’s character.

*This particular text is a good example of learning through association with other members of the polis, probably one’s elders, and thus it taps into the theme of education— particularly moral education—through society.*

	- you got more as a citizen
	- Mainly Vocational teaching from father to son
		- Teaching a son a profession meant assistance in it from him when he’s young and support for you when you are old.

	- Aristotle expressing opinions of what instrument to play and what modes are befitting of what kind of man you are.
	- Mixolydian mode is bad for you
	- Dorian 

### Why is music so big in educational discourse in 600BCE? 

- Character and moral development to teach the cultural core?
	- They want the kids of scales and music which stirrs the soul the right way and what music invokes that 'correct' character.
- Another theory: music was the MEDIUM of transmission (our medium is writing) and we do a lot of talking about what good writing is (strunk and white) and even what tools we use to write (twitter, note-taking tools, etc)
- Music by default became a part of greek education. It was already there and then it became formalized and then people a
> Education emerges from an existing set of existing set of cultural practices, it's only 
- Initially, musikē is just “things of the muses” so poetry in general, and poetry was set to music. So for an oral culture, this was “literature”. The elements that we call “musical
- Okay so that's music

### What about Literature in musikē

- What educational value could you get out of this passage?
- Given 7-14 year olds, what educational value could you get out of this.
- **Performance aspect**: Learn it, enncat it, perform it. 
- **Homer for Moral edification**: This is morally loaded content, oration is a high virtue
- **Teach as Literature:** Whats going on here and ask how it relates to one's own experiences.
- **Structure**: A tool for literacy You know this punctuation and grammar and meter away. 
	- Literary technology for doing punctuation and writing did not exist in 600BCE
	- Dactyllic hexameter


### Politics 8 - Aristotle 
![[Screenshot 2022-02-02 at 10.11.33.png]]

- What constitutes education 
- What is the proper way to be educated
- There is dissagrement on what to learn
- Practically oriented, moraly edifying, or intellectual 
- For a start all men do not share the same virtues so how can they agree
- Its a modern phenomenon that we don't see virtue as central to the goals of education

## Challenges and changes in
https://montessorium.com/blog/early-skepticism-education
- **Skeptical of education 
	- The claim of the educator
		- I can fix people
		- If doctors can set bones. 
		- I can make people wise
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-02-02 at 10.19.34.png]]
	- Talent is better. some people got it, some don't and you should just accept that. It's bleak
	- Saying that we teach people to be smarter and wiser and have good live - I make people smarter better
	- **I can point you to the context, you can be taught by the environment**
- **Canceling Homer (btw homer is never canceled - Why?)**
	- Homer didn't understand the metaphysical nature of reality
	- People in homer don't behave that well
	- People and the gods don't behave that well 
		- If you take the Illiad straight, why are you presenting the gods in this way if we're going to emulate them.
