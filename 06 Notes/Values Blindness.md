>“We’re_ _waiting_ _for_ _a_ _new_ _vision_ _of_ _human_ _nature__._ _Until we have it, we're stuck recycling old models (unions, co-ops, local currencies) or worse, grasping_ _at tech_ _trends__(blockchain, Wikipedia, the "sharing economy").


>__“__History is driven by paradigm shifts about human nature. Each leads to new designs and institutions. Each emphasizes a different aspect of human beings._ _Each new view of human nature reveals a category problem in existing institutions__”

Joe summarises history as such and describes how each paradigm shift brought us back into connection with an inner aspect of ourselves had previously been overlooked. In each instance we seem to remember an inner aspect of ourselves which has been neglected and thus social reform appears quick to follow. 

So I ask what is the category problem in our existing institutions? Joe leaves this clue...

>__“__Markets, voting systems, and social networks all seem blind to our needs for adventurous lives, for_ _community, for meaning, and for love._ _We've learnt that we can't buy adventurous lives or love. People would happily pay, but business can__’t_ _deliver_ _real responses to their needs.__”_

One would probably assume that the majority of us would all vote for love, community and meaning, however these are not direct options found on your typical ballot paper. 

For me, this highlights how 20th century institutions are blind to two types of information:

At the lower level, our current institutions can’t transmit information about values — what’s expressively important to each of us.

At a higher level, they also fail to recognize the social spaces and practices which help us explore, develop, and refine our values.
