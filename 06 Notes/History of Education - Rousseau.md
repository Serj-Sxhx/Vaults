Whats the sketch of his educational framework.

- Children start off in a state of pureness and goodness
- There's 3 ways that children can develop
	- Education by nature - Your brain is developing, your limbs and biology are driving your developing as an organising and growing - The way that nature helps up grow up naturally. - Its important to understand that nature 
	- Education by Things. Education by the objects in the world
		- You learn it by direct experience. 
	- Education by Man. Teaching, books, socialisation, education by other human beings.

Counter to Locke. Kids have Long Pre-rational stage, but don't think about long term, therefore they should be very sensory early on. 

Eventually you enter society but you should delay their exposure to books until teens.

How much do they really care? There's something warped about it. it's less than authentic reasoning. 

What's 

There's school reading at the time, not child literature. So most school reading is drill and kills. Comenius's vision of books did not catch on. 

Novels are seen as morally dubious. There's no harry potter right now. The reports are that children didn't like to read. 

He doesn't have an account for when you should learn how to read. But it should be postponed for a long time - 13/14

Quality and Quantity are opposed. Depth over breadth. Whatever they're going towards they should go towards it. 

His view of moral education. Natural consequences, let the child get hurt, let them figure out by their own accord that if he is careless then he'll get hurt.
	- Children should have 

There's things that you should do 


You should not be educating kids in a specific trade. Learning a trade is awesome but the world is changing and you shouldn't be so specific. 

How might we teach for transfer?

It happens from a sexual awakening and that those biological and emotional interest in others can be be brought through a tutored process.

- What his political outlook is that society teaches us Tyranical or slavish impulses.
	- He's very technical about when to indulge them and when to support their requests. 

**Science vs Education**

If I was going to teach you magnetism theres a few ways you can go about it.

Start in Maxwells Laws, Start with first principles and go from there.

Rosseau, says, If a child is interested in magnets, give them a magnet, see what questions they ask. This is the order of the senses - that each particular object is followed by each question and solution, then new objects and questions and solutions. This is the core empiricist / Enlightenment point. The way to organise information is by How children tend to notice things.

Society is bad for human beings in trying to shape them into things that we think are good but we don't know what that thing is that we want to form them to.

We're not just bad at education but even growing up in society is bad for growing up in.

There's something very unnatural about the way we raise children. The way we do it produces Vein, docile, over obedient or tyranical people.

Negative of the polis teaches the man. 

We view ourselves through the latest technology that we think are awesome. Let's expose our children to it. 

We can use our experience and observation of the world as a way into ourselves. We can be critical of that environment and think about how we mirror the world around us. 

They should be sharing with eachother their models of the world and inquiring into weather or not they're accurate representations of reality based on their observations, experiences and captured propositional knowledge. 

Drill and kill
Picture books 
Games 
F Literacy 

Pushback to Read at 8/9/10. Books 

At the age of 12 the child should have the kind of relationship to their tutor as they have to their dog. 

1600, 1700 The novel is really just being invented.

Better to do a slow authentic, substantive, qualitative, judgement is more important.

Children have needs. As a caregiver you should tend to them sensitively. Children test you with social manipulative cries. If you goto them every time they're going to start manipulating you. 

# Education By Nature

# Education of the Senses
- children don't have much reason. You can't instruct. But you can do alot with senses. You can educate and build judgement via the senses.

# Principled Generalism
![[Screenshot 2022-03-22 at 16.43.47.png]]

- The real calling to be a generalist is because the world is changing.

If you introduce morality early they become corrupted.
