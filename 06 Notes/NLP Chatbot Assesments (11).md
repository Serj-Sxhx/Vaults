Chatbots have become a staple in customer service solutions. They've helped educate customers by asking simple questions to reveal their needs and deliver timely resources in the form of help articles, links and forms. Not only has this saved customer support teams but when chatbots are designed well and support resources are abundant, the customer can often get the support they need faster.

If chatbots became a staple in an autodidact's toolbelt they might help them learn quicker. Autodidact chatbots could ask simple questions to reveal needs, deliver resources, identify gaps in knowledge and support reflection through socratic questioning. Unlike chatbots in customer service, Autodidact chatbots might want to retain the learner's inputs for their personal knowledge system. A body of reflected work could be built with the support of a chatbot who, given a proposition or belief of the learner, could identify the underlying logic in their arguments and tease out questions which could nudge a learner to rebuttal a counter argument, or provide further reasoning for why they think a certain proposition is true. 

Over time, the language model would be trained on my answers, reasoning, questions, notes, tweets. This would provide it with context awareness for any future interactions a learner has with it. 

One of the highest achievements of great teachers is of being able to inspire students as a living 'role model' of certain behaviours or skills. 

Watching my favourite intellectuals debate, engaging in brainstorming with my mentors, critiquing newspaper articles with experts all happen at the speed of mind-to-mind interactions.

What Autodidactic models might lack in affective capacity, they may make up for in speed. 

Being 'taught'.
