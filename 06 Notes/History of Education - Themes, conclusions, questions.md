# A nation at risk 
Regan's proposal "A Nation at risk" 

- If an education system could have been designed by an enemy of the US to undermine National defense of international integrity, but you couldn't do better than the education system we have

it was like a really damning critique of the system. More about mediocracy in education. 

What does it mean to be in the 3rd grade? How do we know if schools are doing well. e.t.c this produced a kind of granular standardisation from the 80s. There's a huge move towards metrics and standards.

back when parents send their kids to school and paid for education, and it was more mastery based there was just more kind of customer oriented assessment of the product.
  
Parents paid tuition and they want their kids to learn to read and they would complain to the teachers if they didn't learn to read or or whatever they were paying for their students with students with would withdraw and when you have universal compulsory education that's free.

At a new scale very rapidly, all of a sudden, this is like a big change in a pretty short time span historically unprepared to the rest of history of education.

The parents like they just send their kids to school and that's the expectation and there's this question as to like okay like, how do we know?

Education schools have two most commonly read books

Theres not a bunch of dewey lab schools, or vocational things like we did during the great depression.

What you get during teacher training its very progressive, deweian and idealist. 

the idea is, we can really use education as a way to question overt and covert power structures in society, but we have to make students a participant in that process like we can't just kind of tell students to do this students kind of actively figuring out how to do this as a very, very, very progressive and a very political.

It's an odd disconnect between teachers schools, 

The cliche complaint is - "I spent you know, three years and 10s of thousands of dollars getting a master's in education, and when I went into the classroom and honestly my master's wasn't that helpful to me. I had to learn, most of what I needed to learn about like classroom management and literacy education.To do my subject like I had to learn that, on the job I learned from my mentor teacher"


Why? Because teachers colleges became common and professionalized and part of the educational establishment. kind of in a top down way it was it was something that was done by progressive educators, in order to help professionalize and change the profession. So teachers called us have always been they didn't exist, basically, and then they were kind of pet project of progressive educators,

Schools have always existed. predating the 20th century by thousands of years.

### Matt's Compression

Education is reactionary to new social organisation and power restructures: Bureaucracy, trade, language, markets, new forms of politics,

- -   00:14:51We looked at early antiquity when education was first emerging and first starting to form into something like more of a system.
    
-   00:15:00And it was physical education and music and abroad sense of music that was meant to culture, you and do something to your soul, it was chromatic a letters.
    
-   00:15:10And there were all these debates about what it should look like like what should the cannon be how to How should it work does it isn't even really effective at all, making you virtuous then we looked at Sparta.
    
-   00:15:21This crazy.
    
-   00:15:24You know totalitarian or need you know pro totalitarian nation state nation state sorry city state, an ancient Greece that had an education system that was laser focused on creating child soldiers.
    
-   00:15:39And that looked very, very different from other kinds of education systems that we've looked at in this class, but that that.
    
-   00:15:46That did serve the function of bringing children to kind of further specific ends looked at Plato read a very philosophical take on education i'm a very intellectual take on education, the point of education was to help you progress.
    
-   00:16:00From more sensory knowledge lower lower kinds of.
    
-   00:16:06State in which the lower parts of your soul were dominant to progressively more intellectual.
    
-   00:16:12items of knowledge forms of living, where those parts of your soul dominated.
    
-   00:16:17Plato had theories of education that were very radical that were in certain ways kind of Spartan ish but but also very different.
    
-   00:16:25But they never really got implemented so what got implemented from Plato, or what we saw carried through from Plato is his conception of mathematics and has more general conception that.
    
-   00:16:36Studying intellectual things studying the pure forms of things studying studying the nomadic objects of our highest areas of burning, such as mathematics.
    
-   00:16:47improves your soul like it is the path of virtue, what is the path to come to kind of knowledge and enlightenment and so education should be organized around.
    
-   00:16:55That idea really stuck with us in some form or another until.
    
-   00:17:01Really until the 20th century with holistic education we saw what actually happened to education in a post Alexander world, so we saw that.
    
-   00:17:09Bureaucracy became increasingly important letters became increasingly important and chromatic a really started dominating.
    
-   00:17:16The other parts of education in a very particular forum where most of it was rote learning.
    
-   00:17:21On there was widespread rote learning, with the aim of creating readers or maybe if you can be a reader a slow reader if you're on the way back to that content they were kind of different levels of literacy.
    
-   00:17:31And we started the process of literacy becoming significantly more widespread and that became really the goal the kind of primary and overriding goal of education for other goals, too, but that became really kind of surface does like this is the job to be done, of education.
    
-   00:17:47We looked in one class that medieval education at the dark ages of the collapse of education, the rise of education that started with higher education.
    
-   00:17:56And we also looked at, we then kind of went along to the Enlightenment, was a comedian lock to people who wanted to and resell so convenient to lock and we're so all wanted to really rethink education, along the lines of the Enlightenment, which is.
    
-   00:18:11We should trust individuals, you need to be able to learn things from the senses education should adapt itself to the individuals optimism about education so maybe we should we should rethink education, just like we're rethinking everything.
    
-   00:18:22It was a very exciting time for education, science, was starting to influence education in spirit, if not in content, the idea that we can discover the world ourselves and the children can do this, and then we should help children do this.
    
-   00:18:34So there are centuries of big ideas and education, the most radical of which was so the whole class on.
    
-   00:18:40And then we looked at what things actually will take an early America, and it was pretty conventional.
    
-   00:18:45That looks like a kind of classical education, not that different from our kind of americanized version of medieval Hellenistic education primary education in that it was kind of one room schoolhouse pretty wrote mostly focused on the language arts mostly focused on possible content.
    
-   00:19:00Certain innovations we're starting to occur, like the mcafee reader certain interesting it's interesting, it was very fragmented very decentralized.
    
-   00:19:08Until the progressives came along, and with the progressives and with Montessori.
    
-   00:19:14We saw that enlightenment spirit, even though the specifics had changed to be a little bit more social and pragmatism democrat, democratic and let's be Kony and.
    
-   00:19:22There was this urge to really rethink education to see traditional education is not serving society anymore, we need to rethink it, we need to rethink it from the ground up.
    
-   00:19:31And we have very powerful thinkers, most notably doing, and the one the two divas thinkers that we looked at in this area we're doing and monastery though Montessori is different from other classes in a certain way.
- Looked at Montessori for focus on early childhood what was distinctive about her, and then we just wrapped up with the 20th century, which I discovered when we went to various strands of.
    
-   00:19:58reform policy philosophy kind of social tendencies that got us to universal compulsory education that was largely traditional and scope but with some modifications from the progressive educators.

# Jason's key points
Ancient education
- Gymnastice
- Musice
- Gramatice absorbs Musice

More time is spent on 8 years on literacy and then advanced study past 16 is in rhetoric that prepares you for political career. 

5th 4th century BCE, Greek thinkers are challenging everything in their society lead by socrates. 

Plato wants to create philosopher kings / rulers by re-aiming the spartan system. 

This sets the ideals for the western canon.

- unintelligible, I think, if you were to tell them we don't try to teach morals in our school I think they would have a hard time understanding how it was a school at all.
    
-   00:32:03Or how it was education that we were engaging in since even the Greek word for education idea is really a word of saying is really a word of child cultural or child raising.

People are not confident talking about virtue in modern times. 

The goal of a state is to make citizens good, and teach virtue.

From locke on wards. The goal of the state is to safe guard rights. Not to tell people how to live their life. 

It's not the job of state education on how to live. 



# Kerry Ellard's key points
- Horace Mann and the New England educators did not intend for there to be a secondary system, a secondary school system that was like national public like they saw that as as primarily a primary school thing.
    
- And so that was just that really was not part of their plan and eat people had to kind of make it up as they went.
    
- And I think in a lot of ways do ease am string strange approach can be understood as and also his appeal and his continuing relevance, has to do with the fact that he was trying to navigate this and he was modeling navigating this confusing world to others in a savvy way.
- paying attention to relationships people around you so people would think they would think about what is the context, what makes sense here, instead of just falling into these structures are these these like false categories, he wanted them to think like what makes sense, what can I do.
    
-  How can I translate things that I know work into something that works in this situation and be aware of all the types of people around me that don't fit into these categories.

### [[What do you do with 15 year olds problem]]

-   What do you do with 15 year olds problem.
    
-   So high school is pretty new.
    
-   Historically, like as like there's this thing that you do after primary school, but before college and most people do, and the fact that, like you know.
    
-   Like 95% of people do high school today is extremely new that used to be what when high school emerged, it was as some sort of systematized college preparatory thing, but this problem goes back to.
    
-   goes back to antiquity were like yeah like as an adult you're going to like participant in political life, maybe you'll study rhetoric, maybe like that there's a bunch of different things if you'll do a military commanders a bunch of things now on your.
    
-  But that's when your education is finished So what do you do, do you like send your kids to get extra military training during this time it's just this kind of awkward period between.
    
-  When you're really ready for studying or doing higher things and and when you when you graduated what we would now today call middle school.
    
-  And I mean the modern solution to that is high school, but it is like it's just again worth pausing on like to kind of awkward problem like should you.
    
- Should you be in school like you're ready for some things are not ready for other things and it's just like it's always been one of the more contentious areas of education, or one last figured out areas of education, because it's very hard to standardize.
    
- 15 year olds are 16 year old seven year olds are very different in terms of their needs and trajectories and Okay, if you acknowledge those differences are you tracking them.
    
- Like in an authoritarian way if you don't acknowledge them or you just like having everybody learned a bunch of crap that most people aren't going to need like it's a difficult problem.
