In order to hide this undeniable but exceedingly unpleasant fact from ourselves and at the same time pay it lip-service to freedom, we have got accustomed to saying apotropaically, "I _have_ such and such desire or habit or feeling of resentment," instead of the more veracious "Such and such a desire or habit of feeling of resentment _has me_"

"Principlaities and powers" are always with us; we have no need to create them even if we could. It is merely incumbent on us to choose the master we wish to serve, so that his service shall be safeguard against being mastered by the "other" whom we have not chosen. we do not _create_ "God", we _choose_ him.
