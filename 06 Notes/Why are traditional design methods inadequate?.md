# **Why are traditional design methods inadequate?**
Modified notes of [[Joe Edelman]]

"Designing social environments is different in an important way from designing tools or experiences. To design social environments requires a different kind of empathy. Most designers are already good at two types of empathy:

-   Goals empathy.
-   Feelings empathy.

But many of us have little practice with a third type: understanding how someone wants to live and to relate with others (in our terminology, understanding their _values_) and helping them to live or relate in that way.

Let’s call that _values-empathy_.

-   If you’re designing tools, then _goals-empathy_ is what you need.
-   If you’re designing an experience for an individual that’s supposed to affect them a certain way — like a film — then _feelings-empathy_ is your bag.

But if you’re designing a social environment — say, an organizational structure, an event, a political system, or a social network — our claim is that you need _values-empathy_.

We uncover values through in-person interviews, surveys, and usage metrics.

And we learn to design systems around values, as well as to measure the connection between systems and values — whether a system supports or blocks the user in living by their values.

Once we recognize a social issue as a failure to live by values, it becomes much easier to investigate what’s happening. The designers’ own experience of trying to be _honest_, _courageous_, etc is often relevant. Designers can ask questions like “what’s hard about being honest?”, “what’s hard about being open-minded?” and “which environments make this hard thing _even harder?”_. Such questions clarify what we must avoid in social designs, in order to avoid social breakdowns. When designers think this way, their designs are better for everyone.

Modern social systems haven’t been designed around values, and we haven’t learned to measure whether systems support us in living by our values. This is causing huge problems." - Joe Edelman

### **For whom are these techniques relevant?**

The class is useful if you design and/or monitor:

-   **technological spaces** (social VR, messaging, team productivity, scheduling, marketplaces),
-   **organizational processes** (meeting styles, org and reporting structures, team operations),
-   **social service environments** (schools, employment centers), or
-   entire **social structures** (basic income, currencies, voting systems)

Our methods are less relevant if your product is a fixed-use, single-player tool (like a video editor) or a fixed-emotional-arc, single-player experience (like a film). With our methods, social solutions are described in terms of the values of your users, and then linked to success metrics for your organizations and products.
