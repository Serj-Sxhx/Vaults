### Education is philosophy developmentalized

You design educational practices based on a fundamental views of human nature.

If you're Prussian/ capitalists/ protestant: Humans are blank slates, they're 'rational-utility maximising self-interested', You're born into debt to god. ~125 y/ later. boom! western education

If you're tibetan/ buddhist: Humans suffer because of desire, everyone is asleep and must wake up to buddha nature. ~2,500 y/ later. boom! Eightfold path, monastic life, middle way

If you're East Asian, Taoist sprinkled with Confucianists & Mohists literature: When people are born, they are naturally good. They have malleable natures and acquire habits based on their passion and heart. ~2,500 y/later. boom! Martial Arts + chuzhong

What are we becoming? What's our new or alternative fundamental view of human nature? How will we let it guide our educational and learning design? What kinds young humans should we be producing? What practices and environments afford what kinds of characters and skills?

What’s needed in both education and it’s surrounding arena, economics, is a new vision of that nature. This will lead to new designs and institutions. Until then we’re just recycling old models and grasping at tech trends like cohort based classes or social emotional learning.

TL:DR 

Structural Functional definitions: 

1: The means by which people explore their definition of a meaningful life, and how to go about perusing it.

2: The character creating function of a society which enables a ratcheting effect of culture. It’s function is to enabling the new generation to take the tools of cultural evolution beyond the limits of the previous generation.

Below a certain level of material and social well-being, and of training and education, people simply cannot take part in society as citizens. Education is positioned alongside other basic rights and entitlements.

Public schooling has two primary responsibilities

Supporting learners 
there is no social world without loss.” There is no society that can accept and accommodate all ways of life however we should

They must be fair to competing values and worldviews by not unduly privileging one over another, while also providing a wide enough range of skills and a wide enough exposure to cultural differences that students understand themselves as freely making reflective decisions about the value and direction of their own lives.

The second responsibility of public schools in a just society is providing for the basic skills needed to pursue a self-chosen conception of the good life.

schools cannot be designed as all-purpose opportunity providers, it is an impossible task. Schools cannot provide the means for everyone to pursue anything and everything; they only exist to provide the means to the further education required to advance a reasonable conception of the good life.


Ivan Illich’s 1971 - [[Deschooling Society]], Has the vision of decentralised “learning webs”
Illich posited that a good educational system should have three purposes:

-   it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives
-   empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them
-   furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known
