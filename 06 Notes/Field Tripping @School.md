A thread on a central line of inquiry I'm on. It's all about educational institutions & ed-tech environments as the character creating functions of a society, where a person is shaped by the array of [[social games]] that they participate in. 

> "Working is not just the creation of economic wealth; it is also always a means of self-creation. Therefore we must also inquire into whether the contents and processes of the work produces the kind of men and women we wish humanity to be made of.” - André Gorz
 
I'm pondering this question. Does the array of social games in educational institutions, the contents and processes, product the kinds of men and women we wish humanity to be made of? 

Their role in society has primarily been a series of daycares and lecture halls that one goes through to find their place in the labour market. Something about the range of social games we can play at school feel's 'narrow'.

I remember moving rooms to stare at the whiteboard to another whiteboard, from teacher-centric classroom to another teacher-centric classroom. And then lunch break, then back to much the same. Maybe music, gym and science practicals break things up.
 
 I defiantly wasn't engaging all the faculties that cognitive science describes when it talks about embodied cognition.
 
 My hypothesis is that the social games available cannot embrace the diversity of learners' curiosities, intelligences, values and inspirations.
 
 To get a feel for what structural features of a social environment might lead to the social norms of the traditional school, I began doing some [field tripping](https://www.notion.so/sxhx/Field-Tripping-159fa53f70da425bb6856ea3f01c0a61)

Field tripping is a practice where you identify the [structural features](https://www.notion.so/humsys/Structural-Features-95c23b58da0d444b84df25d70781d61d) of a space and use your feelings as _suppressed values_ detectors. You could go into a social space (a church, a restaurant, an anarchist bookstore). Look inside and see what value(s) your emotions point to. Try to understand how the structure of the space itself and the processes that take place within it could be crowding out certain values. Ask questions to yourself like, it easy to be vulnerable here? Can I practice playfulness here? Is there space for open ended experimentation here. After listing the structural features you can use this information to come up with initial redesigns that would support the values that are suppressed in the space.
