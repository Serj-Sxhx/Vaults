Risk-taking, playfulness, using my imagination and intuition in my learning; the opposite is being 'rule-bound'.Body

**Inner worlds**

-   Noticing and following feelings of excitement

**Forming and Overlaying your perspective to the field**

-   Changing model and applying it to the field in novel contexts
-   Noticing what the limits of the field or domain is
    -   Noticing what internalized rules I'm playing by
    -   Understand the historical patterns that brought about the domain or field's current shape
        -   Remembering / keep in mind My unique perspective as I approach the field and how it is similar or different to the history of the domain or field
        -   Identifying opportunities and gaps when I can apply my unique perspective.

**Information**

-   Gathering information and inspirations from new fields
    -   Noticing Similarities and differences between the old, the new and my perspective (Nuance)
    -   generate connections between gathered information and the existing information.

**Praxis / application**

-   Imagine alternative futures for the field using your perspective
-   Feeling confident with trying out something un familiar, which may fail
-   Changing course mid plan in favor for other imaginaries.
    -   Noticing when a certain direction or path has already been explored or is not exciting anymore

## What norms make those hard steps easier 

## What norms make those hard steps harder

## Games 

`Norms Surcfing - Leftfield Game`
- Use anne's questions to surface norms 
- Give permission for 10 minutes to think of people this way and see what comes out of it.
- Track ideas and be generative don't critique.

`Find an expert` Bridge building,
Generative - Watch a lecture from and expert of an unrelated but inspiring fields and make connections to what you're working on

`Alternate Future`
How has something that I'm studying changed the future 10 - 50 years from now

`Explore exploit`
- After you play any explore outline 3 experiments 

`Wrong Turns and missed opportunities minority views`
The majority is almost always wrong
- What was the most recent majority view
- What were the minority views
- Why didn't they those views get off the ground.
- Is there anything that we're missing in that because we adopted this majority view. 


`Crazy ideas game`
Takes the stakes out of the risk. 
- Writes down and idea or activity  they think would be exciting for the group but might feel that others think is stupid - that they are worried or afraid to share.
- If you're not affraid come up with a crazy idea
- Read out the list 
- Take it seriously (Serious play) What's going to be so cool about that. 
- Try to find if there's anything interesting or exciting or exciting about that idea.
- List all the great things that would be cool if you went through with it

`Plan B`
Constraints
Mine the plan b's for things that might be worth doing
Or ways that you might change plan A based on Plan B ways.

- Take what looks like essential aspects of what we're about to do
- For now add constraints for those central ways. 
- Now imagine how you would make this project succeed. 
- Synthesis back into Plan A what would be helpful.
