**Exercise** 

---

 Your goal for this exercise it to create a new note and begin interlinking your thinking across your workspace.
 
 I'm going to walk you through a demonstration of me using Backlinks in my notes and in a client project.  
 
 Once you understand how to use backlinks or if you already know how to use backlinks the challenge is 
 to take a new random note everyday for the next week and begin linking related concepts and notes to it.
 
 If you pick a random note and it contains some concept or idea that you havent previously written any notes about, then your goal is to create a new note which contains at least your definition of that missing related concept. 
 
 


Key points 

- Within your notes you'll want a quick way to create links to other related notes and concepts or resources  
- I would advise that you use backlinks inline within the block of text that you're writing in - this allows you to immediatey see the context that surround that note 
- if you have a bunch of links at the top or bottom then you might follow the backlink to this page but have to spend an extra 5 minuites reading through the note to get some context for why they're related .
- often you'll be writing something in a page, maybe it's in a project or a note  or a resources, it doesn't matter where really but you'll begin writing a sentance and when you're about to type a certain word  you'll remember that you've made a note about that concept that you're about to write. that way while staying completely in the flow you can hit the square bracket key twice and this will open up a prompt. Type the title of the note that you've made before and use the arrow keys to navigate the options, press enter when you've selected the relevant note and notion will automatically close the double brackets. 
- THis creates a back link. 
- Clicking on it transports you to that note. 
 this allows you or your reader to wander through your thinking. 
 If you look up here under the title you can see that this note is now telling me that it's being related to 2 other note. If you click on this you can see what note's reference this note within them. 
This creates a rich web of interlinked thinking which leads me onto another important way that you could go about titling and writing your notes.
In the example I jsut showed it's often good practice to write some atomic notes. - That is a note that contains only one concept or idea. 
This often leads to a very fluid writing experience because when you open the double brackets the name of the note will come quite easily to you. 
AGain this is just a suggestion. It's also entirely okay if your notes have long poetic titles aswell but you'll have to reference to them in a more disjoint way by saying things 

like. In my note [[Godzilla eats the catrapillar]] or I talk about this extensively in [[How to wrester a wall streat banker]]

So 


- you could use the relation table property to link note together but that would take too long and become
