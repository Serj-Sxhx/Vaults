We reduce arbitrariness and maximize representativeness by purposely seeking stakeholder qualities in which we’re most interested. We don’t create a sample by picking people arbitrarily (or even pseudorandomly) but instead by an up-front conscious definition of how we’re going to populate the sample. There are several types of purposive samples used in qualitative research:

• Extreme or Deviant Case: Learning from highly unusual manifestations of the phenomenon of interest, such as outstanding success/notable failures, top of the class/dropouts, exotic events, and crises.
• Intensity: Information-rich cases that manifest the phenomenon intensely, but not extremely, such as good students/poor students and above average/below average.
• Maximum Variation: Purposefully picking a wide range of variation on dimensions of interest. It documents unique or diverse variations that have emerged in adapting to different conditions. Identifies important common patterns that cut across variations.
• Homogeneous: Focuses, reduces variation, simplifies analysis, and facilitates group interviewing.
• Typical Case: Illustrates or highlights what is typical, normal, and average.
• Stratified Purposeful: Illustrates characteristics of particular subgroups of interest; facilitates comparisons.
• Critical Case: Permits logical generalization and maximum application of information to other cases, because if it’s true of this one case, it’s likely to be true of all other cases.
• Snowball or Chain: Identifies cases of interest from people who know people who know people who know what cases are information-rich, that is, good examples for study and good interview subjects.
• Criterion: Picking all cases that meet some criterion, such as all children abused in a treatment facility. Quality assurance.
• Theory-Based or Operational Construct: Finding manifestations of a theoretical construct of interest so as to elaborate and examine the construct.
• Confirming or Disconfirming: Elaborating and deepening initial analysis, seeking exceptions, and testing variation.
• Opportunistic: Following new leads during fieldwork, and taking advantage of the unexpected.
• Random Purposeful (still small sample size): Adds credibility to sample when potential purposeful sample is larger than one can handle. Reduces judgment within a purposeful category. (Not for generalizations or representativeness.)
• Politically Important Cases: Attracts attention to the study (or avoids attracting undesired attention by purposefully eliminating from the sample politically sensitive cases).
• Convenience: Saves time, money, and effort. Poorest rational and lowest credibility. Yields information-poor cases.
• Combination or Mixed Purposeful: Triangulation, flexibility, and meets multiple interests and needs.
Any one of these can be considered a way to select which stakeholders to work with
