In an earlier note I sketched the view taht we swim in a sea of choices. We face menus, options and different qualities of information.

In this note i'll build on  Joe Edelman's perspective on some implications of Ruth Chang's work in the philosophy of choice making that make learning ecosystems conducive to the development of character: An act of self-creation via exploring, defining and refining one's 'values'. 

In this sea of choices, individuals construct goals and hope to make choices on information and menus that they don't regret. 

Non-regretful choices constitute some kind of 'meaning' in one's life. 

Everyone has made a regretful choice at some point in life. Perhaps going to crossfit classes wasn't a fit for you, or going on holiday with strangers left you feeling weird for a week. 

But when it came to making choices again in the same contexts / menus (Fitness classes or holiday decisions) you were able to aware of something else that you should be paying attention to. Something more important and acted differently and therefore felt non-regret or even positive emotions.

Perhaps a goal was overly specif

This happens all the time. Perhaps a goal was overly specific, was dependent on some other goal in a way we didn‘t understand, was founded on a misunderstanding, or was just less compelling than a goal or value we hadn’t thought of yet.

In this map, an arrow is drawn when people tend to migrate from one activity to another activity, and the latter activity is reported to satisfy their desires more effectively.

In which situations do our values shift in this way? And how can we make sure that users remain in charge of their own values, rather than having them directed by the device?

Philosopher Ruth Chang has argued, it seems likely that we define and adjust our values while making choices.

Specifically, we evolve our values when we have an initial difficulty making a choice because one option seems better in some ways, and another better in a different way.

Dr. Chang suggests✱ ✱ It would be good to have better data about these moments of value reconsideration.these are the moments where we reexamine and change our values, and that we often choose _a new, more general value_ for ourselves that makes the choice more clear.

If this is correct, we need a name for the environments in which this activity of self-construction can proceed fluidly. We will call these _environments of expressive choice_.

To make an expressive choice, users must be able to explore a space of values that might apply to the choice, and to organize the options _in front of them_ in terms of whatever they decide _matters to them_
