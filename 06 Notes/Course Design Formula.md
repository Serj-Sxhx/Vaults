- Benefits
	- “This book will save you time, money, and energy and spare you from frustration as you set up your online course. It will teach you research-based principles of how people learn, and what effective teaching does to ensure that people learn. It also will help you understand how effective teaching in the online space differs from effective teaching conducted face to face. This will be especially helpful to you if you are an experienced face-to-face teacher or presenter and now you want to teach online with the same level of elegance, effectiveness, and grace. If you’ve never taught at all in any context, this book will help you start out on the right footing by designing your online course for the way people learn best. So, let’s begin!”

- What is learning, and how can we tell if it’s happening?
- Are people actually learning what they’re trying to learn?
- Are we helping people learn effectively, online?

> What does rebbeca say about this ???
 
 - “From the learner’s perspective, there is a difference between learning something and simply being exposed to information.”



### Facts

[[Working Memory]] - “I’ll mention that this so-called narrow doorway is working memory, the brain’s ability to process new information”

[[To long-term memory]] - Schemes which are nural correlations of associated concepts ideas and sense sensations. This is facilitated by the connectome

[[Nine Event of Instruction]]

“Your course has different levels:
 
The whole-course level
The module level
The lesson level
The content level”

“THERE’S A DIFFERENCE between telling someone something and teaching it to them. ”

In The Essentials of Learning for Instruction, educational researcher and theorist Robert M. Gagné, Ph.D., defines instruction as the “arrangement of external events to activate and support the internal processes of learning.”3
What does that imply for your online course? Here are three definitions to remember.
 
Learning is the process of taking in new information through the brain’s narrow doorway and processing it for long-term storage.
Teaching means arranging a series of events in ways that support learning.
Therefore, teaching means arranging a series of events that support the processing and long-term storage of new information.


### Analogies 
Reviewing Bloom’s taxonomy again, we remind ourselves of the following.
Lower-order thinking skills include:
 
- Remembering.
- Understanding.
- Applying what was learned.
 
Higher-order thinking skills include:
 
- Analyzing new information.
- Evaluating it (or using it to evaluate other things).
- Creating something new that demonstrates the learning that has taken place



-“The Human Cost of Poor Instructional Design”
	- “In his wonderful book The Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman points out that when something doesn’t work right, we as users of that object or device tend to blame ourselves.8 We assume the item is fine and there’s something wrong with us for not being able to figure out how to make it work. But that is often not the case. Often the item really is poorly designed.
	Poorly designed objects and tools are not just dangerous, they make us feel bad about ourselves. They make us feel incompetent and unintelligent and inept. And that’s what a poorly designed door handle can do. Now think about a poorly designed course that someone purchased to promote their survival or wellbeing, or to achieve an important goal in their life.”
	
`4 Different ways of Accessing Information: Learning Modalities`
- Visual
	- “When you think of teaching online in a visual way, expand your thinking beyond just video. Multimedia best practices suggest that still images work better than quick-moving video images, because they allow students to focus on the information long enough to process and remember it.8 Unlike video, still images allow the learner to control the pace of instruction.
	- You can use this principle to design still images that convey the information you are teaching in visual ways. You also can encourage students to observe things in their actual physical environments visually. And you can have them read text. In addition, you can provide them with links to websites where they can observe and learn visually.”

- Auditory
	- “Audio files will clearly appeal to students who learn best by listening. But auditory learning in an online context is more complex than that, because e-learning produces a change in the way sensory preferences intersect with the subject matter.
	- Even students who are generally visual learners, for example, will prefer audio lessons if the only time they have to focus on your course material is during their daily commute or while working out or doing household chores. They may be visual learners on a personal level, but they become de facto auditory learners on a logistical level if their visual systems are being used for other things while they’re accessing your course materials.
	- “your course will be richer for all your students and will especially appeal to those who are auditory learners, if you include material that allows your students to learn through listening.


- Tactile
	- “Tactile learners learn best through touching and getting their hands on objects directly.”

- Kinesthetic 
	- “Kinesthetic learning revolves around movement and involves the whole body.”


`Different Ways of Processing Information:`

Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences explores the many different ways that people learn. The multiple intelligences are:
- Linguistic intelligence (“word smart”),
- Logical-mathematical intelligence (“number/reasoning smart”),
- Spatial intelligence (“picture smart”),
- Bodily kinesthetic intelligence (“body smart”),
- Musical intelligence (“music smart”),
- Interpersonal intelligence (“people smart”),
- Intrapersonal intelligence (“self-smart”), and
- Naturalist intelligence (“nature smart”).

Howard Gardiner. Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (New York: Basic Books, 1983). Also see: “Resources,” MI Oasis (accessed July 6, 2019), https://www.multipleintelligencesoasis.org/resources; and “Multiple Intelligences,” American Institute for Learning and Human Development (accessed July 6, 2019), http://www.institute4learning.com/multiple_ intelligences.php


the multiple intelligences focus on areas of interest and ways of processing information once we have taken it in.

The frameworks describing learning styles and multiple intelligences overlap in some ways, though they are not identical. For example, someone who prefers to learn visually could have high linguistic intelligence and love to read words in books or on the screen.
But a different visual learner could dislike reading words and instead would learn best by looking at pictures (spatial intelligence) or by reading music on a page (musical intelligence).
A third visual learner could learn best by walking through a forest looking at trees (naturalist intelligence).
It’s understandable that someone with an auditory learning style might enjoy listening to music because they might have high musical intelligence. But an auditory learner could also be tone deaf when it comes to music and prefer listening to people speak, extracting the nuances of what someone really means by using interpersonal intelligence.




 
### Strategies
Prior to Instruction
“Event 1: Gain the Learner’s Attention”
“Event 2: Tell Them What They Will Learn in This Lesson”
“Event 3: Help Learners Focus on Their Prior Relevant Knowledge”
While you present the instruction
“Event 4: Present the Instruction”
“Event 5: Provide Guided Practice”
“Event 6: Help Learners Perform on Their Own”
After Instruction
“Event 7: Provide Learners with Feedback on How Well They Did”
“Event 8: Help Learners Assess Their Learning and Performance”


The way to do that is to start with the course goal (what will your learners be able to do after taking your course, that they could not do before?) and work backward step by step to be sure you are very clear on all the prior knowledge needed for each lesson. 

Then, when you actually teach the course, you can just move forward through that same sequence of steps. You will have the necessary prior knowledge needed for each lesson spelled out clearly, and you can share what the prior knowledge is with your learners as you teach.

Let’s look at a specific example to understand how this is going to work. I’m randomly picking a course topic out of the air: “How to Bake a Cake.”

Question 1: What is the course goal? (Meaning: What will learners be able to do after completing the course that they can’t do now?)

Answer: The learners will be able to bake a cake.

That seems simple enough, but there are some other things we need to know before we can delve deeper, such as:
 
- How well will the learner be able to bake a cake?
- Under what conditions?
- Using what equipment?

“How’s this: Given a cake recipe, raw ingredients, an oven, and baking utensils, learners will be able to bake a cake that at least 80 percent of their friends and family eat without coercion and pronounce “delicious.”
The sentence above is called a student learning objective or instructional objective.
You can create your own student learning objectives using this handy Mad Lib®-style student-learning-objective generator that I’ve created just for you.
 
“Given ________, students will be able to ________ to ________standards of achievement, as demonstrated by ________.”

Now, if your final course goal is for students to be able to bake an edible cake, what are the smaller lesson goals leading up to that? You can see from your learning objective that students will need to be able to:
 
Read a recipe.
Identify and obtain raw ingredients.
Operate an oven.
Identify and use baking utensils.
 
That is the prior knowledge your learners will need to have in order to accomplish the course goal. From this list, you can see that a logical lesson sequence for your course would be:
 
1. Read the recipe.

2. Get the ingredients.

3. Prepare the ingredients.

4. Bake the cake.

5. Cool the cake.

6. Frost and decorate the cake.

7. Invite people to eat the cake”



`Learner-Centered Design`

“Even if you are an experienced teacher in face-to-face settings, teaching online is different. Teaching online requires you to manage cognitive load differently than you would in a physical classroom and brings in a different set of affordances and constraints”



This is for the design of linear Instructor Led Online courses. If you are designing a student led curriculum or mirco-content content curriculum then not all of the principles oulined here will apply to your design. However you might still gain some valuable knowledge about how to approach online course design. 

use a backward design process to ensure your learners end up at point B. They have to, because you’ve first clearly defined point B, and then built your course backwards from there.



You’ll be creating your learning content at various levels: the course level, the module level, the lesson level, and the learning object level.”

“Everything in your course must lead directly to the course learning goal. At each level, start by determining the learning goal for that level. Your course needs a single, clear learning goal, and so does each module, lesson, and learning object in your course. All of the smaller learning goals (at the module level and below) must lead to the learning goal for the course as a whole.
Design from the largest/highest level downward, in the following sequence:”

Excerpt From: Rebecca Frost Cuevas. “Course Design Formula: How to Teach Anything to Anyone Online”. Apple Books. 

The Course Design Process
	1. Determine the one, all-encompassing transformation your course delivers.
	2. Discover the course’s domain of learning
	3. Set up your modules based on the course’s domain of learning.
	4. Lay out the lessons inside each module based on the module’s domain of learning.
	5. Plan each lesson to include all nine of the nine events of instruction.
	6. Select the optimal media to present each piece of content in each lesson.
	7. Build your course.
	
### The Course Design Process 
“HOW THE FORMULA WORKS: AN OVERVIEW”
	1. Determine your course learning goal.
	2. Discover the domain of learning for the course, based on its learning goal.
	3. Set up your modules based on the course’s domain of learning.
	4. Set up the lessons inside each module.
	5. Plan each lesson.
	6. Select the media you will use to create each learning object within each lesson.
	7. Build each lesson.


 
As you go through those steps, remember the following principles:
 
- Every lesson must have a clear learning objective.
- The lesson learning objective must lead to the module learning objective.
- The module learning objective must lead to the course learning goal.
- Build guided practice, feedback, and assessment into every lesson.


Test, Iterate, Refine
	An online course is a living thing (at least, it should be), because the learner experience is an important aspect of the course. From your first beta tester to your ultimate testimonial, what you learn about how your course is working in actual practice, matters. It matters more than anything else, because the whole point of your course is to help people learn.
	That’s why it’s important to be open minded and professional when listening to learner feedback

TIps 
- Use pictures to provide context for related text.
- Present new information in small chunks.
- Provide explicit guidance on how to process each chunk.
- Remove anything that doesn’t absolutely have to be there.

In addition to identifying curiosity, self-efficacy, and achievement as factors that increase learner motivation, Gagné also further elaborated on the ARCS model of motivational factors originally developed by J.M. Keller. The acronym ARCS is short for attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.4 Gagné’s recommendations based on that model include:
 
- Hold learners’ attention by varying the format you use for presenting the material.
- Help learners grasp complex abstract ideas by using concrete examples and analogies.
- Provoke curiosity with paradox, surprise, conflict, humor, incongruities, and jokes.
 
Here are some ways, based on the ARCS model, that you can build motivating factors into your course, modules, and lessons.7
 
To gain attention:
 
- Use varying formats.
- Make abstract ideas clear and easy to grasp.
- Incorporate humor, paradox, and surprise.

To enhance learner confidence:
 
- Present clear, skills-based learning objectives.
- Sequence learning tasks in small segments.
- Allow the learner to achieve success at each step.
- Allow learners to control lesson sequence and pace.

To ensure learner satisfaction:
 
- Provide performance-based feedback at every step of the learning sequence.
- Help students generalize the learning to a larger context beyond the immediate lesson.”

“Ask yourself, How can I make learners curious about what’s coming next? How can I encourage them to take effective action on their own behalf, rather than just absorbing the course material passively? How can I build a strong learner achievement component into my lessons?”




- An intellectual skills/ how to course works best if set up like this:
	- Big ideas
	- Ingredients/tools
	- Steps to perform the procedure
	- Exceptions to the rules”

- If your course teachers a motor skill (Movement) Then set it up like this:
	- “If your course teaches a motor skill (movement) then set it up like this: 
	- Teach the individual movement components
	- Put the components together to create a movement routine
	- Help learners practice the routine
	- Provide immediate feedback
	- Provide ongoing practice (including mental rehearsal of the routine) until it’s automatic”

- “Set a mindset course up like this:”
	- Ineffective mindset choices
	- The right (effective, helpful) mindset choice
	- Role models
	- Find your why (both your short-term and long-term motivations)
	- Ongoing support”

- “For a cognitive strategy course (learning how to learn about something), your modules will look like this:”
	- “Explain the strategy
	- Help learners practice the strategy”
	- Provide feedback


By starting at the highest, most inclusive level and working downward, you ensure that every item in your course contributes directly to helping your learners achieve the course learning goal, which is the transformation you are promising them. The learning goal for each component in your course must contribute to the larger learning goal of the course as a whole.


One way you can do this is to outline your high level transformation then break it into chunks. You can do this by repeatedly asking. In order to achieve the high level transformation transformation what smaller transformations will they have to complete. 

`Intro Hooks`

“One way you can simultaneously gain learners’ attention and tell them what they are going to learn is to present a short, self-scoring online quiz or challenge inviting them to perform the skill they will be learning about in this lesson.
Examples:
 
“Can you stand on one foot for two minutes without losing your balance?”
“How many of the capitals of Europe do you know?”
“Do you wish you could balance your checkbook in your sleep?”
“How fabulous would it be to lose weight and keep it off, without feeling hungry?”
 
That’s the gaining attention part.
Then, once you’ve got the learners’ attention, tell them how the specific content of this course, module, or lesson will make it possible for them to do that very thing that they are not able to do now. For example:
 
“In this course, we will learn five techniques for improving balance on each side of the body.”
“By the time you are done with this lesson, you will know the capital of every country in the world.”
“What I am about to teach you will put your financial record keeping on autopilot for the rest of your life.”
“Dr. Smith’s program has helped thousands of people lose weight and keep it off. We will explore all phases of his program in this course. Let’s start right now by learning which foods are allowed, which aren’t, and why.


`“Help Learners Focus on Their Prior Relevant Knowledge”`

A lot of the art of teaching so that people really learn resides in correctly identifying the prior knowledge your learners need, and then ensuring that they have it. If your learners don’t already have the prior knowledge they need to learn the new subject matter, then the art of teaching consists in building that necessary prior knowledge directly into the structure of your lesson.

Ask them to do a brain dump of all the ways that thy've tried to previously tried to organize their knowledge.

- Sample Survey	
	- “SAMPLE SURVEY

HERE ARE QUESTIONS you could include in your survey:

What worked well for you with this module, to help you learn (the module learning goal)?

What could have worked better for you with this module?

Ask a few questions to help you find out the degree to which they’ve mastered the material in the module.

A rating scale: how helpful was this module in helping you achieve the module learning goal?

An open-ended question asking them to explain why they gave the module the rating they did.

Also leave a space for them to say anything else that they want to share about their experience with this module.”

### Test & Helpful Notes

Rubrics 
	- “Rubrics. In creating assessments for your course, it’s important to be clear on the exact learning you are evaluating. The best way to clarify this, for yourself and your learners, is to create a rubric. A rubric is a chart that lists the skills you expect your learners to develop, the behaviors you expect them to exhibit, or the activities you expect them to perform. To set up a rubric, create a document with rows and columns giving you a series of boxes. A table that you can create in a text document works very well for this. I’ve created a blank template you can fill in to create your own rubric. You can download this on my website (see “Next Steps”). Use the boxes in the first column (down the left side of the table) to write the individual skills, behaviors, or activities your learners must complete in order to achieve the learning goal for your lesson. (You can also create rubrics for each module, and for your course as a whole, if you want). Use the boxes in the first row along the top of your table, to write your evaluation scale (for example: Poor/Fair/Good or. point  2 points / 3 points / 5 points - then fille in the boxs to the right of each skill.



4 Types of Assessment 
Self Assessment
Peer Assessment
Instructor Assessment
Automated


“What they are seeking from an online course, however, goes beyond information. They are seeking transformation. They want to go from being a person who is at point A to a person who is at point B, a person who possesses the talents and abilities and skill sets that can only be found at point B, the course learning goal.”

`A pedagogical question`

“There has been a debate among educators regarding the efficacy of different ways of approaching learning and teaching. One school of thought, represented by educational theorists such as Jerome Bruner and Jean Piaget, advocates allowing learners to explore and come to their own discoveries about the world, much as children do when engaging in free play.1 The other school of thought, represented by educational theorists such Richard Mayer, Paul Kirschner, John Sweller, and Richard Clark, finds that learning must be tightly focused, structured, and controlled in order to ensure that learners learn what they need to.2
Which school of thought is right?
It turns out they both are, but only when placed in the right context.”

“Discovery Learning vs. Guided Instruction”

---

“Transformative teaching requires that you demonstrate skill in three dimensions, which are:
 
- Subject matter knowledge
- Teaching skill (which online means, instructional design skill)
- Understanding learners’ needs
