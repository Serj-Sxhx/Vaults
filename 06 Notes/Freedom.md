> You cannot be free until you gain volitional choice over where you place your attention - Idris shah 

### Develop multi dimensional awareness.

Build an open aperture to all different dimensions - don't collapse them. They are all interconnected and influence eachother. 

To be aware of as many, or focus on any dimensions at choice, or no dimension would be freedom. The more dimension you can be aware of, the higher the subjective experience of freedom.  

1) The external world - the world that you see, chairs, cars - visualizing doesn't change the external world. when you confuse levels or collapse levels, awareness shrinks and, you loose dimensions of awareness and loose freedom.

2) Thinking - Belief system, thoughts ideas, narratives, internal subjective experience -> Working & Ps

3) Situational Emotional - Anger sadness fear, 
	If someone breaks into your house you'll be angry
	
4) Biological - The nervous system's goal of survival.
All of you life is spent focusing on 4 areas
	- eating sleeping 
	- going to the bathroom
	- or having sex 
	- or making more money so you have a better place to do it in 
	**Quantum Psych**

5) Essence - Peace, love with no object joy, Loving, forgiving
	You always feel love - it's always accessible. -> Mediation 
	

All forms of psychology have weak suits and strong suits which support the various dimensions.
