### The language technology: writing

pictograph - Seen
ideograph - Imagined
logographs - Read

rebus Principle- using it for it's sound 
logo graphs can be used for sounds 

Syllabaries - Each syllable has a character

Abjads ( Consonants)

Alphabets (Consonants + Vowels)

Alpha syllabaries (Syllable = Consonant + vowel )

**Tradeoffs**
Meanings or sound
Reader or writer 
Information or recognition 
Flexibility or consistency

Egyptians started removing letters which creates consonants

Sumerians combining into 

Semantic - Meaning, encoding the meanings of words
Phonetic - Sound encoding speech sound

Rebus - produced phonetic languages 
where people encode speech sounds 

China used logographs.

Rebus means we confuse the logographic symbol of sun for 
`Logo` Sun, 
`Rebus` son, soon or sown

Han scribes noticed they could use both systems rebus and logograph

By adding Determinatives (Symbols before of after a seperate logograph which sounds like the word for multiple phonetic things) tells you how to read the sound character by adding a semantic context.

e.g. 
Moon 
Amputate your feet 
and key

all have the same logograph as they all sound the same. But add the determanative for knife to moon or add the determanative for metal to key and you get a new word.

Moon 
Moon + Knife = Amputate your feet 
Metal + Moon = Key

This give you clear meaning and clear pronunciation.

Han Determanatives are called **radicals**

Mayan Script Syllabary 

Each character is for each syllable pronounceable

But if the syllable isn't in a vowel and your word ends in no vowel
e.g. Balam for Jaguar

Then you have a few options 
Underspelling - Ignore the last letter 
Echo vowel - Spell the last letter that repeats the last vowel so you know to exclude it

Echo vowel e.g. Balama is Balam

Logo graphs do develop and they use the phonetic syllables to clarify a logograph of Jaguar 

It helps both ways.

Lists of consonants are Alphabets 

They were built out of simplifying Hieroglyphs in the mines where there 
isn't time to write hieroglyphs.

Eastern Med adopts alphabets through Venetian traders who sold paper.

Semitic languages evolve.
-	Akkadian 
-	Ethiopian
-	Arabic
-	Hebrew
-	Aramaic
-	Phoenician

Greeks think that Phoenician consonants are useful but 
All the extra characters for huffing and clearing your throat 
and ahhh and wooo 

They are barbarian sounds. 

Alphabets used to be a list of consonants that make up a word, when you notice the word, the job is done.

**New alphabet**
One sound, one character - Consonant + Vowel


Semitic scripts evolve

Missing vowels create ambiguous situations

Matres lectionis 
Mothers of reading - 

Abjad can be doubled as their consonants or a vowel.

This adds a new kind of ambiguity. One character, multiple sounds

Scribes also add vowel dots above and below consonants for clear reading so struggling learners don't confuse the vowels.


Ashoka in India 

A law of tolerance across the land.

Each syllable is a character with it's on - like abjad
But you don't need a separate character per each separate syllable like Mayan
If you add a vowel to left right top or bottom, it's a new sylable 
(Consonant + Vowel) + (Vowel + Consonant) = hybrid system / India
Consonant, vowel, consonant, vowel = Alphabet 
And there is also a hush stroke to kill the end sounds of words 

It's an Indic **alphasyllabary  **

Ligatures (Commonly linked characters)

Spreads to Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Tibet and Nepal. 

Ethiopic languages do the same as indic 



Korean Hangul 

Syllable is a block 
Konsonants and vowels are arranged in blocks
