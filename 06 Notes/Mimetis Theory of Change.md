**Impact **
:  is the systemic change that you expect to see in the long term

**Outcomes **
: outcomes are the intended and unintended changes that your stakeholders are
experiencing or might experience with your intervention in other words outcomes are the broader benefits we work to achieve
e.g. 
increasing job placement by measuring the number of people placed and retained after their onboarding training

long-term midterm and short-term outcomes as you demonstrate clear improvement in your outcomes you are more likely to get other players such as government or public and private partners to step in and to help you scale your mission good outcome measurement requires designing a stakeholder survey that includes baseline mid line and exit line results




**Outputs **

: the outputs are the immediate results of our activities or products and they are necessary for achieving the outcomes think of them as positive indicators that the outcomes are on track as per our skills development example one output could be the increase in the number of people graduating from a business training


**Activities **
: what activities need to take place for each output to happen providing people with high-quality training is one of the activities directly aligned with our sample output and outcome along with quality skill building training an activity can also include resume preparation or interview preparation all of these increase the number of successful placement possibilities
