## What norms make those hard steps easier 


Trust / Respect - Healthy Disagreement - Positive Regard 

Dynamic Leadership

Check ins for motivations 
Check ins on emotions

Re framing frequently, 
Updating the problem between us.

Intellectual humility - See both sides of an argument


## What norms make those hard steps harder



## Games Brainstorm 
`Soul window`

`Name the norms - Norm Bomb`
Generally track power, status & tension, e.g. awkwardness

Everyone write on pieces of paper:  
In this space it matters to be...  
In this space being .... means attending to/doing/not doing...  

Who is in charge here? 
What do they avoid/steer away from/cannot handle w grace/push out?  
What would be awkward to do here? -- clowning  
  What do I feel nervous about doing here? -- why not  
  What's not yet safe to bring here, to show here? 
  What do I feel shy about? -- 
  What do I not want them to know about me? -- Out of character  
  How is status assigned here?  
  What do ppl perform here?  
  What do people hold back here?  
  
Titrate what feels pushed out of space. Bring a little of it into the space and see if people relax or tighten. See who tightens. Check out what they need to ease in. (Vibe wars)  
  
How are the people I see here incomplete? What part that they are likely to have do they not bring?  
 
Who could I intro to this space who'd break this vibe?


`End of the rainbow`
- Everybody writes down what they hope will be the case when they finish the project 
- Sign up for other people's outcomes (we share this outcome or we both believe in that / me too)
- Sign up to support other people's outcomes (I really want that for you)
- Use this as a reference to motivate eachother when the going gets tough. 
- Periodically Re assess if the outcomes are still desirable or if they there new desirable outcomes. 



`Idealogical self sabotage` 
- First outlines their take on what the problem is / topic or approach is.
- Search for these two kinds of information and present your case.
- What information would prove my take wrong
- What are the strongest arguments I can think of against my take.
- Discussion if that information would prove it wrong.

`Question Box` High school Christmas / Plotline demolition dynamics
- Pose a problem that you're working on and the ways you tried tried to solve it already to the group
- Every one writes a question to me that would most help me find the solution on a piece of paper and passes it to you. 
- `Enduring version `
	- Leave your top problem or question on the front of your question box
	- Your team / fiends can write useful questions and put them in your box whenever  

`First principles Frame Check`
- At the start of the projects - Identify and the write down your current assumptions.
- Then breakdown the problem into it's fundamental principles.
- Ideate on new solutions from scratch.
- periodically, revisit your assumptions, check for new fundamental principles - 
- Critique your current solution and decide weather to change course.

`Five Whys - problem cause finding`
- Find the level to intervene and make changes

`Good reasons`
Everybodies reasons for thinking what they think are all valid. No ones 

- When there's different views of ways forwards
- Make the motivations explicate of the idea makers by asking them why. 
- interviewee gives 3 - 5 reasons why this is the best
- 1 Person asks the why for each reason. ( This finds the limit of the reason aswell)
- The interviewee and interviewer try to decide if they are good or not??? The interviewee can cross out any reasons which they don't want to be shared with the group that they now see as bad reasons
- Look at the options + the reasons with the group
- Deliberate as a group and see if you can come to a consensus on the best way given the reasons
- If you can't then try to make new solutions that would incorporate what they think are the most important reasons from both sides.

`Reverse job Interview`
- Instead of naming all the reasons why you'd be so great for this project and self reporting what we're great at 
- Name all the things that we might not be the best at.
	- Why are we not the people to make this project a reality?
- Find suitable roles for team members that keep them in their strengths.
-	What circumstances / what


`Best worst work`
We don't want to figure out if you boss was an asshole 
we want to figure out specifically how your boss was an asshole, and what specifically we want to avoid. We want to find the abstract principle that's at work that we can avoid next time
Find the practice that would protect the value. 

*rules*

- share your Worst and best projects
- Interview them why that was so great

- how were you able to approach your work that was great for you
- How were you not able to approach your work that made it shitty.

- Ask 'What was more important to you. Is it more about this or more about that?' or other questions 

The rest of the group is responsible for trying to supporting you to do and not do that by creating a list of best practices for that team and workspace that everyone is responsible for not overstepping.

`How should you lead me?`
The best way to lead 
- List of ways that this team admired and was inspired by in their other / some / previous leader. 
- Each team has a list allowing future leaders to always stay connected to what's important for that team. 

`Secret admirer Game`
- anonymous turn in 
- " I really like how X does Y"


`Annonymous doubt club  ` 
Anonymously post doubts about a project either on sticky notes on the white board
or with Questions 

` Time line check` 
- Explain what you're doing 
- everyone trys to write down how long they think it's going to take to complete it
- Then take the average of group times or have a discussion on what's realistic.
