# The virtuous cycle of learning (Vcol) and its +7 skills

VCoLs engage the whole learner. By this, we mean that they engage learners emotionally, physically, and intellectually, leveraging both conscious and unconscious mental processes. They ensure that new knowledge is integrated into existing knowledge in a way that makes it useful and "sticky."


### Vcol Stages
- Set
- Seek
- Apply 
- Reflect


### 1. Self & Other awareness 
Awareness micro-VCoLing structured around practices that involve...

-   observing and documenting thoughts, feelings, or behavior
-   self-evaluation
-   practicing non-judgmental openness to experience
-   meditation
-   mindfulness in everyday life
-   somatic practices, like yoga
-   coherence practices, like HeartMath

### 2. Making connections 
Connection micro-VCoLing¬†structured around practices that involve...

-   brainstorming
-   Minto Pyramid problem solving
-   polarity thinking (or both / and thinking)
-   mind mapping
-   causal loop diagramming (or other systems mapping approaches)
-   building relational databases

### 3. Seeking & evaluating information 
Seeking & evaluating micro-VCoLing¬†structured around practices that involve...

-   active listening
-   deep listening (Kramer)
-   seeking clarification
-   ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù research
-   critical thinking
-   action inquiry (particularly second-person action inquiry)
-   the scientific method

### 4. Applying knowledge
Application micro-VCoLing¬†structured around practices that involve‚Ä¶

-   action learning
-   project-based learning
-   developing action plans or development plans
-   rehearsing‚Äîreducing risk by trying out new knowledge in hypothetical situations
-   writing or critical discourse‚Äîusing new knowledge to improve an argument or message

### 5. Reflectivity 

Reflectivity micro-VCoLing¬†structured around practices that involve‚Ä¶

-   making sure that learning goals are ‚Äújust right‚Äù
-   embedding learning in real life, as a part of everyday activities
-   not punishing learners for making mistakes‚Äîhelping them see mistakes as a source of useful information
-   ensuring that every learning cycle, no matter how small, ends with goal setting

### 6. Seeking & working with feedback

Feedback micro-VCoLing¬†structured around practices that involve‚Ä¶

-   openness to feedback
-   awareness of your own defensiveness
-   feedback seeking skills (like helping others feel comfortable providing you with feedback)
-   skills for evaluating and incorporating feedback
-   second-person action inquiry
-   participation in focus groups
-   customer or employee surveys
- 
### 7.  Overcoming Biases 

De-biasing micro-VCoLing¬†structured around practices that involve‚Ä¶

-   cultivating humility‚Äîrecognizing the ubiquity of human fallibility
-   building critical thinking skills
-   regularly seeking feedback
-   tackling common cognitive biases, one at a time (e.g., conservation bias, bandwagon effect, stereotyping, or attribution bias)

Unlike conventional study skills‚Äîwhich are designed primarily to help students learn factual information well enough to pass academic tests‚ÄîVCoLs are designed to build the knowledge, deep understanding, _and_ skills we need to navigate the complexity and ambiguity of our lives.


What is a Vcol 

Unlike conventional study skills‚Äîwhich are designed primarily to help students learn factual information well enough to pass academic tests‚ÄîVCoLs are designed to build the knowledge, deep understanding, _and_ skills we need to navigate the complexity and ambiguity of our lives.


# Fundamental Practices

To support optimal learning with Vcol 

1.  Determine the current level of a learner‚Äôs knowledge and skills.
2.  Find out what they are most interested in learning via [[Authentic Inquiry]]
3.  Help them select learning goals that are in their Goldilocks Zone (the range in which a learning task is just challenging enough to support optimal learning).
4.  Show them how to achieve these goals with everyday VCoLing ([especially micro-VCoLing](https://theo-dawson.medium.com/learning-in-the-moment-how-to-use-micro-vcols-to-learn-optimally-on-the-fly-185d700804b)).
5.  Embed at least one +7 skill in every VCoL.
6.  Understand that real learning‚Äîlearning that changes the way we think and behave‚Äîtakes time (and benefits greatly from an environment in which ongoing learning, application, and reflection are actively supported).
