As society entres the 21st centurary. it faces an important educational challenge: How can we help people become engaged, at all levels, in learning how to think and behave in increasingly complex systems? More and more practitioners and acedemis alike adhere to a simple premise when desigining learning experiences: en-gage the mind and the body. 

In their powerful book, an unused itelligence, andy bryner and dawna markova warn that the western culture of education leaves the problem-solvng potential of our bodies virtually untapped. With this we wholeheartedly con-cur, and would add that the systems thinking and systems sensing potential of our bodies had been untapped aswell.

We have tried to set up the playbook so that anyone, from a line manage to a CEO, teacher, parent or student, can read it and use it and find something meaningful 

You don't need to be an organizational development professional or trainer to use these exercises. 
As you use these exercises, write down your experiences. What worked, what got the "ah ha!" what did not. 

This Playbook will be a living document. You stories, suggestions and questions will be woven through the next volune so others can benifit from your wiseom. Please send your comments to the e-mail address, or use Notion comments feature.

Helpful Framing things 
	The way you frame an exercise can significantly influence the mindset participants bring to it and the lessons they take away. By frame we mean the story you tell or the metaphore you use to give meaning to an practice. It includes the precise formulation of goals guidelines and criteria for success. Selecting and presenting an appropriate and compelling frame is an art facilitators develop with practice.

## Guiding Ideas

This playbook gives experiential practices for learning systems thinking. The practices highlight these concepts, providing insights into these complex ideas in novel ways.

Experientially, you will raise awareness of the "habits of mind" found in a systems thinker. And I invite you to have some serious fun while you're at it.

**Systems Dynamics**
: The study of cause and effect relationships and delays in complex systems

**Mental Models**
: Deeply held beliefs, assumptions, stories and pictures of how we believe the world works

**Ways of a systems thinker**
Some one who:
-Sees the whole picture 
- Changes perspectives to see new leverage points in complex systems
- Looks for interdependencies 
- Considers how mental models create our futures 
- Pays attention and gives voice to the long-term
- "Goes wide", using peripheral vision to see complex cause and effect relationships
- Finds where unanticipated consequences emerge
- Lovers the "Water line" to focus on the structure not on blame
- Holds the tension of paradox and controversy without trying to resolve it quickly.

**Creating an environment for learning**
- Before the session:
	- Consider Group size: Eight to twelve is an ideal size to produce helpful group dynamics and for everyone to be heard.
	- Share the intent of your work right up front: Share the underpinnings of your design.
	- As for consent before recording sessions: Recordings can cause participants to become very self-conscious, changing the normal behaviours
	- Pay attention to the seating arrangements: Half moons and circles
	- Clear Up-front communication about the session
	- Consider diverse backgrounds: Some exercises don't translate directly into different cultures. Do tests before then modify
- During the session:
	- Encourage "whole speak" (Mind, heart and spirit). Encourage participants to slow down the pace and speak authentically from heart and head.
	- Use a check in: Allow people to intro themselves. "What do you need to take care of or let go to be fully present"
	- Provide participation options: Norm of Challenge by choice to remind people to participate at their own comfort level. Silence or passing should be proposed, acceptable and always an option.
	

## Mind Grooving
### Exercise 1: Color, Furniture Flower
- Purpose:
	- To raise awareness of habitual patterns of thinking.
	- To become aware of how the grooves in our brains impact reflective thinking
	- To limber up - provide mental massage for those reflective thinking muscles
	- To focus on developing the observer in ourselves so we more often have our thoughts as opposed to "being had" by them
- Outcomes
	- Enhanced Abilities to better understand our own thinking processes #Reflectiveness 
	- Reflection on how often automatic though processes can obstruct learning, communication and systems thinking #Overcomingbiases

## Community Maze 
Powerful but long setup. Maybe compress to support teamwork.
- Purpose
	- To explore the discipline of team learning: Tapping into the emerging collective intelligence and memory of the group.
	- To look at the cost of missing the "Win-Win" Opportunities and the benefits of "collaborative competition" 
	- To explore the interdependent nature of complex systems
- Outcomes
	- Experience one or more barriers to team learning. For example under-utilized interpersonal and group inquiry skills. 
	- A real-time experience of how inadequate feedback in systems hinders the learning process
- Context
	- Ideal for teams and work groups, especially relevant for those working in groups that are being asked to exchange information and knowledge with multiple groups in an organization.
