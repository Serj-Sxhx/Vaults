In the city as a school there are 4 layers at which the ecosystems approach must integrate to enable a true open world experience for the various stake holder

Learners,
Parents
Learning experience providers
Coaches
Employers
Heavy assets and facility owners


Layer 1: The Physical layer: Buildings, Colearning spaces, makerspaces Universities, Libraries, community spaces, each tool in the the facility (IOT)

**Challenges** partnerships and onboarding of formal educational providers, validation of informal places of learning. QR codes for every workstation, 3D printer, music studio. Security and transport.  

Layer 2: The learning providers: Skilled locals expertise, remote tutors, online course creators, corporate partners, local employers. 

**Challenges** providers have to be validated, maybe even trained, profit splits agreements with course providers, coaches and studio spaces. Requires facilitation with industry to design projects that would demonstrate readiness for employability [[QBC's partnering with industry (20)]]

Layer 3: The exAPI Maintainer layer: Guides ( Coach / community organizer / facilitator) and [[Scribes]](Public knowledge resource maintainers supported by A.I. NLP tools). 

Guides use Jearni psychometric formative assessment in a predetermined cadence with their learners and facilitate [[Moai Teachback]] at the end of every month to facilitate virtuous  cycles of learning [[Vcol + 7]] 

**Challenges** Requires incredibly high amount of self leadership, highly trained in Self directed leadership, developmental psychology, learning sciences. High integrity and dynamic with the needs of their Moai(s)

Their app the reveals to them workplaces and facilities that they can use to complete those quests, potential skilled people and courses to attend for specialized experiences that help them gain skills and complete those quests. If they're skilled enough they can just complete the main quests and build projects that demonstrate competency to employers via [[Dynamic Portfolio (23)]]. They can also opt in to a [[Learning Moai]], where they will be met by a Guide who can help them improve their [[Learning power]] and keep them accountable with peers on overlapping learning journeys by attending [[Learning Moai]] at a [[Learning Moai Cadance (1)]]

**Challenges** Learners changing their minds (churn), Gaming the system.
