- A big literary work like homer
- Tell, practice / drill Pedagogy
- Pedagogy is drawing from curriculum in various ways, direct and indirect 


# Aims 

### Edification 
-   And people will not give up on this idea I mean it's just it's just part of the pitches part of the products that in some way in some form.
    
-   00:56:41either because you're learning about Achilles and Achilles this good and somehow that will make you good.
    
-   00:56:46Or, because you are learning rhetoric and dialectic that's doing good things to your brain and your soul and virtuous intellectual and that's going to make you good.
    
-   00:56:55or you're learning about the polis and how the polis is great and you're learning the speech or you're earning the speeches of Jefferson.
    
-   00:57:02And you're learning about the declaration of independence of those things are great of those those things are kind of.
- inculcating you into a civic structure that's going to help make you good, or at least help you participate in a very, very good society and kind of make you more susceptible to whatever of the society is was will help make you good and foster virtue.

By supporting the learner to reflect on their choices as they navigate diverse social games leads to moral edification. 

# In what conditions does education occur

-   it's it's not being driven driven by theory it's being driven by the market by kind of practical concerns primarily um so yeah so you have this model that that's pretty philosophical and that emerges pretty naturally.
    
-  In cultures that achieve a certain level of wealth and literacy, such that the systematic upbringing of the youth.
    
-   00:59:20starts to become possible to be concerned about and then and then increasingly necessary to be concerned about as kind of powers of language become more and more important for your for your status for your for your influence in life, for your ability to participate in society.

# Then there's two things you can do

- You can tweek it.
- Maybe less lyre and more piano
- Less mastery and more interest based 


# The other thing you can do its obliterate it and achieve escape velocity

-   You can try to achieve escape velocity.
    
-   01:02:12And this is really.
    
-   01:02:14it's not that the 20th century, is the only time that you see this.
    
-   01:02:19But.
    
-   01:02:20it's the main time that you see this, so you start to see movements to radically change the curriculum even to eliminate.
    
-   01:02:30To make the curriculum, not at all based on kind of focused subject matters to make to make it not based on textbooks at all, and they get based on inquiry and exploration and activity of the child and group group activities and.
    
-   01:02:44Which is, which also implies a huge change in the pedagogy from like a teacher is an authority figure who tells you what to do and tells you when you're wrong to like something very different or the students are you know figuring things out on their own, or.
    
-   01:02:58You can you can change the school structure.
    
-   01:03:01You can you can think about what are the, what are the names here should the am just be like get a student to job should we kind of merge vocational training with general education and some of the classes are good.
    
-   01:03:10These are bigger changes and if, if you want to do this project, and there are good reasons to want to do this project, I mean, I think that there are very, very good reasons to look at this default state and think.

# What are you going to replace the system with. 

- How are you going to get people the knowledge that they need?

- People that try to escape it often end up getting sucked back into it.

# Cognitive Revolution 

-   And this is applied to education, and so, at the same time, developmental researchers also falling into this paradigm, so the pH at again school of thought gets up taking them to kind of.
    
-   01:09:27run through the cognitive revolution it's actually part of the content revolution in certain ways, but it really run through it and you get modern developmental psychology i'm in the form of people like Alison gopnik who who are applying this.

# Why are both left and right narratives fundamentally off?

-   they're both missing there I think they're both missing the bigger story which is that.
    
-   01:20:46Education is something that we never really figured out and still we don't have the answers and it's going to take a lot of work to get the answers.
    
-   01:20:54And the progressives kind of assume that something vaguely progressive is the answer, and that and that we kind of moved away from that's worth or attarian reasons.
    
-   01:21:03And the traditionalist and education that can be a traditional education, people like best or people like her, think that we used to have the answer and I don't think the answer.
    
-   01:21:12What we had as a default model.
    
-   01:21:14And the thing the key silver bullet is the big question the trophy The prize is what replaces it.
