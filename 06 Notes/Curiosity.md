## What are the key dimensions of curiosity?

Upon collecting data from a nationally representative sample of 508 adults, and then 403 adults online, and thenÂ another nationally representative sample of 3,000 adults, we uncovered 5 dimensions of curiosity:

1. **Joyous Exploration.**Â This is the prototype of curiosityâ€”the recognition and desire to seek out new knowledge and information, and the subsequent joy of learning and growing.Â 

2. **Deprivation Sensitivity.** This dimension has a distinct emotional tone, with anxiety and tension being more prominent than joyâ€”pondering abstract or complex ideas, trying to solve problems, and seeking to reduce gaps in knowledge.

3. **[Stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress "Psychology Today looks at Stress") Tolerance.** This dimension is about the willingness to embrace the doubt, confusion, anxiety, and other forms of distress that arise from exploring new, unexpected, complex, mysterious, or obscure events.

4. **Social Curiosity.** Wanting to know what other people are thinking and doing by observing, talking, or listening in to conversations.

5. **[Thrill Seeking](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/sensation-seeking "Psychology Today looks at Thrill Seeking").**Â TheÂ willingness to take physical, social, and financial risks to acquire varied, complex, and intense experiences.

## What are observable behaviours that might indicate if someone is curious?

-	Trading Scarce resources in pursuit of information - In contexts where time and resources that support existence (Food, water, money, shelter) are provided, deeply curious people engage in activities that trade the security of these resources to pursue information. 

-	Social Curiosity - Despite social anxiety and risk people who are curious still engage in conversations driven by questions with strangers. 
	-	Measured via SCS curiosity,sociability, popularity, self-esteem, anxiety, and shyness.Answers were given on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (def-initely true) to 4 (definitely not true). Renner, B. (2006)

- Fantasy & Dreams - Weak indicator as it may point to mental obsessions aswell as topics which have been on the mind of a person for sustained periods. 

- Sustained Engagement and pursuit of information - This relates to behaviours of long periods of time engaged in the activity of finding new and related  information.

- Diversity of interconnected sources - Curious people who are also high in traits associated with creativity can connect informational relationships between diverse multiple sources.
