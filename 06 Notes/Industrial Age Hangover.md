We are currently living in the hangover of industrial style educational systems.  Innovators, designers and reformists, stumble. sloppily. Drunk; wading our way through the pervasive school yard, and regimented classroom behaviours in our streets workforces and policies.

There's been no finer time opportunity to imagine what learning together could be. The industrial age educational system was designed for a few specific purposes. One of those was to sort the wheat from the chaff. The complaint and 'intelligent' from the manual factory workers. 

This industrial age mentality of mass production and mass control still runs deep in schools even in our 'automation', 'information' 'anthropocene' age.

It will be a slow burn to shake off the Industrial Age Norms that prevail.
The norms that educate children by batches and govern their lives by ringing bells. The norms that sets standards for conformity over diversity for adherence to pre-specified rules over autonomy and self-directed learning. For memorization over creative thinking. For individuality over collaboration. For passivity over self motivation for success over the importance of failure and resilience. For analytical cognitive skills over empathy and emotional intelligence. 

The post-industrial world is requiring a new set of competencies from us as individuals and from our education system. An emerging paradigm hinges around holism and the decentralization of education. A system that advances learners  from routine cognitive skills to enabling them to manage complex ways of thinking, complex ways of work and that requires a very different caliber of Education
