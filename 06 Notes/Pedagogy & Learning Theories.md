# Pedagogy 
pedagogy exists to compare and re-evaluate our ways of teaching, to think how it can be done differently and how we can improve. However teachers are rarely given the time to learn more about learning theory and pedagogy. The teacher workload survey shows that teacher's workloads are continually on the rise which might mean that teachers have less time to study the theory behind their craft. 

I made this compressed guide to explore 4 core learning theories behind the art, craft and science of pedagogy.

### Where did the word Pedagogy come from? 

The word pedagogy comes from the ancient Greek 'paidagōgós',
which literally means 'leader of children'.

### 1898 Behaviorism 
Notable pioneers
[[Edward Thorndike]]
[[BF Skinner]]

Behaviorism centers around the idea that the teacher should be in control of the classroom and that repetition is the best way to learn. It all started with a Edward Thorndike's experiments with a cat in a box.

The cat was placed in a puzzle box and was rewarded with a treat for working out the levers and buttons to press in order to free itself. Thorndike found that the cat associated escaping from the box with getting a treat and escaped faster each time. This is called: [[operand conditioning]] and it forms the basis of behaviorism.

Psychologists like [[BF Skinner]] applied these findings to the classroom and argued that teachers needed complete control of the classroom for students to learn best. Skinner pioneered the first learning machines which allowed students to input answers to questions and immediately find out if they were right or wrong. He called this reinforcement.

How do we know if we're not rewarding the wrong behaviours? 
Doesn't this depend soley on the knowledge and accuracy from the teachers?
It is very teacher centric.

like Thorndike's cat, the student learns the right behavior over time through immediate feedback. Today, behaviorism reminds us that giving praise doesn't just encourage students, but guides them and give some structure to their learning. But what this fails to take into account is individual thinking and giving learners independence. When a teacher, or a machine, is given complete control, the student isn't as likely to develop critical thinking and self-expression. By only taking into account of observable behaviour, not what's going on in students' minds, learning can't realistically be tailored to students' needs.

### 1964 Liberationism
Notable pioneers
[[Paulo Freire]]

Unlike behaviorism, liberationism centers around the student, not the teacher. 
Pioneered by [[Paulo Freire]], Friere saw traditional teaching methods as oppressive. He believed that students were not empty vessels to be filled with knowledge. Instead, they should be treated as creators of knowledge. He wrote in his book, [[The Pedagogy of the Oppressed]], that education can emancipate those in poverty and that the main thing preventing this was the school system. He thought that it was important to empower student's to find out how they learn best and decide what topics they needed to learn more about. This encouraged them to become critical thinkers outside of the classroom

The key difference here is the view that standard teaching fills students' minds with information in the same way that you would pour water into a cup. Freire's theory was that if you can give the cup arms it can fill itself.

Liberationism is a pedagogy that expels the idea that education is simply about learning things and makes it more about the way we learn. Full-blown liberationism puts the student front and centre of learning. As Hall of Fame teacher Joe Ruhl says "Teachers should be a guide on the side, rather than a sage on the stage." 

By breaking away from the traditional structure of the classroom and having cluster groups of students, a classroom can encapsulate more learning styles. With liberationism, students decide which task they think is best suited to their knowledge gaps. They can then join specific task groups with teachers acting as the guide on the side.

### Social constructivism.
[[Lev Vygotsky]]

Social constructivism is an approach to pedagogy that explores whether students chatting in the class might actually be learning more. Granted, they might just be talking about Love Island, but the idea is that the social interaction could be a key component in the learning experience. Social constructivism was championed by [[Lev Vygotsky]]. Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist that believed that children learnt best when talking between themselves to solve the problems. It was built on an existing theory by another psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], who believed that students' capacity for learning increased as their academic ability grew. This was called 'cognitive constructivism'. But whilst Piaget believed that learning was a deeply personal internal process that took place only in students' minds, social constructivists like Vygotsky disagreed.

Vygotsky believed that learning takes place externally when problems are solved together in groups and through the resulting conversations. So can this environment be created in class? Constructivism works best when time is set aside for students to discuss the topic with each other and with the teacher. In class the teacher sets a problem that is to be solved in mixed ability groups, this teaches students the importance of communication and learning from others' experience. Students that are further ahead benefit from solidifying the information for their peers and the students who are slightly behind will have a chance to catch up.

### 2005 Connectivism
[[George Siemens]]

Connectivism is one of the newest approaches to pedagogy. Coined in 2005 by education and technology theorist [[George Siemens]], it considers the impact of technology in education and how teachers can adapt to it. This approach can be broadly defined as the process of learning via technology and developing the skills to navigate vast networks of information, such as the Internet. It applies the function of modern technology to all these ideas to create a learning theory for the future. In 2008, Siemens ran an online webinar that explored and explained connectivism. He created a diverse learning environment, completely contained within the internet, but connectivism is more than online learning. It's teaching students to be learners in a digital age. It may have been a pipe dream in the classroom of old, but with an ever increasing EdTech presence in school and at home, connectivism is here to stay. Students can learn wherever they log in and, once given the skills to navigate this world of information, use it to further their learning and develop autonomously. This could be done in a more traditional setting like a teacher led classroom with computers or in a classroom where the teacher sets the work that can be completed with the help of the internet. Instead of simply teaching knowledge the teacher's there to facilitate students' search for knowledge by showing them how to extract it. Some teachers have taken to using Twitter with students answering questions through tweets. This boosts engagement by applying the digital world they're familiar with to the work they might not otherwise want to do. It's clear that technology in the classroom isn't going anywhere, so preparing for its effects on education is definitely a good move.
