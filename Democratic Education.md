: Democratic education is often specifically emancipatory, with the students' voices being equal to the teacher's.

Democratic schools are very diverse but they can all be defined by having two key principles. In other words, it can be said that all democratic schools have these two characteristics in common:

1. Democratic governance: Meetings in which all members of the school community can participate

2. Autonomy for the students to manage their own learning process

# History

In 1693, [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") published _[Some Thoughts Concerning Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Thoughts_Concerning_Education "Some Thoughts Concerning Education")_. In describing the teaching of children, he declares,

> None of the things they are to learn, should ever be made a burthen to them, or impos'd on them as a task. Whatever is so propos'd, presently becomes irksome; the mind takes an aversion to it, though before it were a thing of delight or indifferency. Let a child but be order'd to whip his top at a certain time every day, whether he has or has not a mind to it; let this be but requir'd of him as a duty, wherein he must spend so many hours morning and afternoon, and see whether he will not soon be weary of any play at this rate.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_education#cite_note-3)

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau")’s book of advice on education, _[Émile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile,_or_On_Education "Emile, or On Education")_, was first published in 1762. Émile, the imaginary pupil he uses for illustration, was only to learn what he could appreciate as useful.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_education#cite_note-4) He was to enjoy his lessons, and learn to rely on his own judgement and experience. “The tutor must not lay down precepts, he must let them be discovered,”[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_education#cite_note-5) wrote Rousseau, and urged him not make Émile learn science, but let him discover it.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_education#cite_note-6) He also said that we should not substitute books for personal experience because this does not teach us to reason; it teaches us to use other people's reasoning; it teaches us to believe a great deal but never to know anything.
