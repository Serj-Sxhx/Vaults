The commons are shared resources. Forests, fisheries, or groundwater resources, are traditional examples. Increasingly we see the term commons used for a broader set of domains, such as, digital commons, urban commons knowledge commons. Let's talk about knowledge commons.

The **knowledge commons** refers to information, data, and content that is collectively owned and managed by a community of users, particularly over the Internet.

However unlike commons of shared physical resources, digital resources are non subtractable, meaning multiple users can access the same digital resources with no effect on their quantity or quality.

MIT open course ware, Wikipedia, Open source software repositories, Youtube, this micro essay all constitute the knowledge commons.

Garret Hardin, an American ecologist, put forward the idea in 1968. The argument is simple.  
  
Common resources inevitably get exploited and become depleted by agents wanting to maximise their individual gain. It's a scenario where extraction leads to accelerated extraction. As one actor cuts down trees, they gain an advantage (more optimal know how, more resources, first mover advantage e.t.c). All parties then seek to maximise their own benefit from the same common resource and get invent new methods for getting ahead of each-other before the commons, run out.

The tragedy of the commons shows us how, without some sort of regulation or public transparency of choices and actions associated with public goods, there's no incentive for individuals to hold themselves back from taking too much. In fact, individuals may even have a “use it or lose it” mentality; if they’re aware of the inevitability that the good itself will be depleted, they may think, “I better get my share while I still can."

So great, the knowledge commons doesn't suffer from extraction and depletion, however it faces another wildly stressful problem. Continual addition and therefore, noise.

Curation, and synthesis are the tools that we so desperately need right now and it's currently the job of a small group of indie creators, online communities

It's not a good scenario besides the fact that actors innovate to discover new ways to out-compete each other and maximise extraction. This innovation

Ferenc Gyuris argues, that it is important to distinguish "information" from "knowledge" in defining the term "knowledge commons". [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons#cite_note-13) He argues that "knowledge as a shared resource" requires that both information must become accessible and potential recipients must become able and willing to internalize it as 'knowledge'.

_"Therefore, knowledge cannot become a shared resource without a complex set of institutions and practices that give the opportunity to potential recipients to gain the necessary abilities and willingness"_

This already is and increasingly will be, the central challenge for the next generation of educational institutions and technologies. Turning the vast ocean of information into procedural knowledge (skill) will be and art that's not exclusive to teachers.
