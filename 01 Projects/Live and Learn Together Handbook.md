A handbook and central resource for a Paideia. A community of practice, committed to the development and raising of healthy, wise and adaptive humans that can participate fully in their society. 

### What is a Paideia 
A paideia is Greek word with wide ranging connotations. It is broadly about the practice of raising of younger members of society. In modern society, the responsibility of a paideia is often spread across multiple institutions, domains and social groups. Members within families, schools, corporations, medical and therapeutic institutions, caregivers and even law enforcement form and contribute to the broader societal paideia. 

# Who is this for?
- Home school parents
- Parents
- K-12 Teachers
- University professors
- Instructional designers
- Learning Experience Designers

# The problem
Being unable to learn something new and have agency when approaching risk and uncertainty is often to do with a lack of learning power.

Beyond teaching propositions and processes, many members of a paideia (MOP) struggle to support [[Learning power]]

The [[Dimensions of learning power (Jearni)]] contribute to one's sense of agency over their learning. They are dispositions which describe the form of intelligence possessed by someone who, to quote [[Jean Piaget]] 

> "â€¦knows what to do when they don't know what to do."

 Often even when dimensions of learning power are diagnosed as depressed MOP and Jearni Coaches currently co-construct new pedagogical strategies and practices with their students or adult learners.

 The challenge however for MOPs and people who are not qualified Jearni coaches is a lack of training and experience in pedagogy. 
 
 Because of this they are faced with a learning curve and narrow imagination / intuition of what strategies and practices can support their learners.
 
 This handbook is a central text which aims to provide MOP and Jearni Coaches with design inspiration, experiential training and resources to create learning strategies and practices that support learning power.

# Solution Description

The final deliverable will be a 'Handbook' containing over 32 practices, and pedagogic strategies for supporting [[Learning power]], [[Vcol + 7]] and the [[Perennial Problems]].

The Paideia community of practice will be supported by a Facebook community.

The Handbook will be accessible via a Notion website that looks similar to:
- [Superorganizers-Wiki](https://optemization.com/superorganizers-wiki)
- [Future Togetherness Notion](https://www.notion.so/humsys/Future-Togetherness-Handbook-3ea8b4d78fbc47028f4854ec052e7316)

It can be deployed in 
- Schools 
- Daycares
- Kindergarten
- Coliving communities
- Communities of practice
- Research groups
- At home 
- Within your org.

The live and learn together handbook is a central resource for a paideia. 

We will be designing the live and learn handbook from a 'social practice first' perspective. By prototyping and capturing dynamics and features that support a learner's values we hope that we can design technology to support new forms of social practice that embrace multiple intelligences, life meaning and development of character. 

Using Human-Systems.org social design methodology we hope to inform the creation of tech that actually supports 'meaning in life', 'Time well sent' aswell as achievement of learning outcomes and personal goals.
