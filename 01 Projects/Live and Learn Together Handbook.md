A handbook and central resource for a Paideia. A community of practice, committed to the development and raising of healthy, wise and adaptive humans that can participate fully in their society. 

### What is a Paideia 
A paideia is Greek word with wide ranging connotations. It is broadly about the practice of raising of younger members of society. In modern society, the responsibility of a paideia is often spread across multiple institutions, domains and social groups. Members within families, schools, corporations, medical and therapeutic institutions, caregivers and even law enforcement form and contribute to the broader societal paideia. 

# Who is this for?
- Home school parents
- Parents
- K-12 Teachers 
- University professors
- Instructional designers
- Learning Experience Designers

# The problem
Beyond teaching propositions and processes, many members of a paideia (MOP) have not identified what contributes to learning power. The [[Dimensions of learning power (Jearni)]] contribute to one's sense of agency over their learning. They are dispositions which describe the form of intelligence possessed by someone who, to quote [[Jean Piaget]] 

> "‚Ä¶knows what to do when they don't know what to do."

 Often even when dimensions of learning power are diagnosed as depresses MOP and Jearni Coaches currently co-construct new pedagogical strategies and practices with with their students or adult learners.

 The challenge however is that MOP's and New Jearni Coaches may support learners under their care with little or no training and experience in pedagogy. Because of this they are faced with a learning curve and narrow imagination / intuition of what strategies and practices can support their learners. 
 
 How might we provide MOP and Jearni Coaches with design inspiration, experiential training and resources to create the best learning strategies and practices for their learner's?
 

### **Macro problems that this connects to**

Today's learning institutions such as schools, cannot embrace the diversity of learners' curiosities, intelligences, values and inspirations. 

Remote Teachers are struggling to create engaging activities for group learning via zoom. Students are feeling disengaged unseen and unsupported.

Parents are either a) overwhelmed and ill prepared as a result of adopting dysfunctional parenting strategies from their parents or never receiving any kind of support around parenting strategies b) struggle to create safe learning activities and environments for their children. 

And everything got worse due to covid and lockdown. 

Arguably this is a brilliant time to rethink weather we want things to 'go back to normal' or to imagine new futures where the norms around how we learn and live together should be totally different.

### For Jearni - The problem

When Jearni coaches and teachers enter conversation with their students or employees they currently co-design new learning goals and strategies in the moment without supporting resources to draw from to guide their construction. Each learner's values and needs are unique so no one practice is every perfect 'out of the box'. That being said, having a 

Jearni is a formative self-report questionnaire for assessing the development of learning power. 

[[Learning power]] refers to the collection of psychological traits and skills that enable a person to engage effectively with a variety of learning challenges. The concept emerged during the 1980s and 90s, for example in the writings of the cognitive scientist, [[Guy Claxton]], as a way of describing the form of intelligence possessed by someone who, to quote [[Jean Piaget]] 
> "‚Ä¶knows what to do when they don't know what to do."

The eight learning power dimensions are holistic personal qualities which combine thinking, feeling and doing. They are inter-related, changeable and influence by our context and relationships. [[Dimensions of learning power (Jearni)]]

### Narrow Social Games, Narrow Intelligence
[[Field Tripping @School]]

Schools and universities role in society has primarily been a series of daycares and lecture halls that a learner goes through to find their place in the labor market. 

Industrial aged education is extremely effective at achieving what it was designed for. That is, producing and filtering obedient working class citizens from those who can work hard enough to ace tests and be obedient in upper-class careers such as management, medicine, finance, and law. 

Because of this many industrial aged education systems have not placed a great deal on creating opportunities for developing skills that prepare students to be lifelong learners, or to develop social and emotional sensitivities.

### Why & How 

On the institutional level, certain norms and the low variety of social games that learners participate in leads to the restriction of certain values and selects for only a narrow set of intelligences. 

A person's choices and therefore character are shaped by the array of social games that they participate in. For example, if you practice in the social game of debates, you'll become someone who tends towards XYZ. If you are someone who practices often in sharing circles like alcoholics anonymous you might find that it's meaningful to practice certain types of honesty and vulnerability.  

Current learning design is narrow therefore 'moulds' certain types of characters. If you aren't so high in traits like agreeableness and conciensiousness  and it doesn't mould you, then it often risks overlooking your unique talents, inspirations and values or straight up kills a child's creativity. 

On the family level, the pandemic has forced parents to draw upon the wisdom of their communities as. Parents now face the challenges of either a) being overwhelmed and ill prepared as a result of adopting dysfunctional parenting strategies from their parents or never receiving any kind of support around parenting strategies b) creating fun learning activities while schools are closed. 

>_"Working is not just the creation of economic wealth; it is also always a means of self-creation. Therefore we must also inquire into whether the contents and processes of the work produces the kind of men and women we wish humanity to be made of.‚Äù - Andr√© Gorz_

We must ask if the content and process of learning in modern schools and universities are creating the kind of men and women we wish humanity to be made of. 

One other key challenge is face by all designers of educational technologies. Despite many bold claims by players like Sal Kahn 


### Problem Two - How Ed-Tech has failed to disrupt the classroom 


# Solution Description

The final deliverable will be a 'Handbook' containing around 32 practices, and pedagogic strategies for learning and collaborating growing together. The Paideia community of practice will be supported by a Facebook community

The Handbook will be accessible via a Notion website that looks similar to:
- [Superorganizers-Wiki](https://optemization.com/superorganizers-wiki)
- [Future Togetherness Notion](https://www.notion.so/humsys/Future-Togetherness-Handbook-3ea8b4d78fbc47028f4854ec052e7316)

[**Final Deliverable Draft**](https://www.notion.so/sxhx/Live-and-Learn-Together-Handbook-72660a5e8fe5443f8a42396df6da31af)

The live and learn together handbook is a central resource for a paideia. 

We will be designing the live and learn handbook from a 'social practice first' perspective. By prototyping and capturing dynamics and features that support a learner's values we hope that we can design technology to support new forms of social practice that embrace multiple intelligences, life meaning and development of character. 

Using Human-Systems.org social design methodology we hope to inform the creation of tech that actually supports 'meaning in life' 'Time well sent' aswell as achievement of learning outcomes and personal goals.
