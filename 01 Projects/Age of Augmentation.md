- The Age of Augmentation

- What is an augmentor
- Why do we need them
	- Instructor led 
	- Algorithm led
	- Peer led
	- A combination of peer driven, mentor guided and AI content assisted is the new intersection for ed-tech to focus on. 
	  
	  Moocs - nuff said.
	  Why? - AI adaptive tutors have only been effective in Maths and English.

- What's new about all this? 

Some would say, in the course of the next 20 years, more will change around the way we learn and do our work than has happened in the last 2,000. 

My bet is that this change will take much longer than the technologists predict. Static institutions and lack of directed political will 


I'm certain that horizon that dawn of a new age in human history.

There have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work, the tech we've harnessed, and the form of our social organisation.

The Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years.
And then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years.
The Industrial Age lasted a couple of centuries.
And now the Information Age has lasted just a few decades.
Now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.

The Augmented Age.

In this new era, your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented by computational systems that help you think, robotic systems that help you make, and a digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.

We don't tend to think of ourselves this way, but we're already augmented. Imagine you're at a party, and somebody asks you a question that you don't know the answer to. If you have smartphone, in a few seconds, you can know the answer. But this is just a primitive beginning.

Even Siri is just a passive tool.

In fact, for the last three-and-a-half million years, the tools that we've had have been completely passive. They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.

Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.
The chisel only carves where the artist points it.
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.

In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,
we've always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools like, manual, literally using our hands, even with computers.

But even that is coming to an end. I want to have a conversation with a computer. I want to say, "Computer, let's design a car," and the computer shows me a car. And I say, "No, more fast-looking, and less German," and bang, the computer shows me an option.

That conversation might be a little ways off, probably less than many of us think, but right now, we're working on it.

Tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative.

Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry and data to come up with new designs all by themselves.


All it needs are your goals and your constraints.

## What is an Augmentor 

This new age requires a new age kind of 'educator' 
It used to be the case that humans relied on 

For the lineage tradition this will still be the case.

For the vast majority of human knowledge, this relationship is 

Super history to human bandwidth is much higher.


As an Augmentor you're pursuit of freedom understanding  to reduce suffering of all beings in all time in all space through the pursuit of understanding.


What is understanding? 
By understanding your 
Interior self, 
Exterior Self 
Interior Collective 
External Collective 

You'll become integrated. 

The world around you is not as it seems. It's moved by

And there's holes in everything that you think is 'real'.
