A handbook of principles and practices for designing meaningful, effective and emotionally engaging [learning experiences](https://lxd.org/).

## What is Learning Experience Design (LXD)

The process of facilitating the development of leaners by providing them with a systematic set of learning experiences and activities supported by content, feedback and technology.

## Where did it come from?

Learning Experience Design is a highly interdisciplinary field. It emerged from the intersection of user experience design (UX), cognitive science, pedagogy and learning & development. People enter the field with very different backgrounds, bringing with them a blend of practices and methods.

## What is learning?

Learning is messy, often informal, non-linear and complex. It's everything from curiosity to paraphrasing, imagination to social savvy-ness. It's really squishy stuff that's really difficult to measure.


For that reason, we have to simplify it a little. Let's start with this simple model.

![[LXD Experience + Reflection.png]]

For the purposes of this guide we'll define learning as:

> _knowledge_ _construction_ through moment to moment reflective interactions with our social and physical environments.

It can be very immediate, like burning your hand. Or entrained like athletic drills and playing video games.

It's a combination of feed-forward and feed-back loops that assess an environment, set goals, takes actions and then reflects on the results against previous memories.

Memory is a very strange thing that science is still getting to grips with. Learning has a lot to do with the dynamic interaction of senses and memory.

## Learning and Identity

A great deal of an identity is constructed by memories. The collection of childhood experiences informs how you view and present yourself in the world. Our identities are the locus of our ability to go forward into the world, learn, create social connections, develop and effect change.

Learning sports is difficult if you get bad marks in the gym class. You won't see yourself as 'The sporty type'. If learning and reflection impacts memory then we're also getting involved with identity. We have to be mindful of how we guide a learners reflection, what information we share with them and the language we use. More on this in the **Assessment chapter.**

![[LXD Identity & Measurment.png]]

Questions of what constitutes a good life and morality, what is right and wrong, help an identity to develop. Creating environments where learners can get clear on those questions might seem out of scope. However, morality, self-worth, life meaning and motivations underpin effective learning.

## Knowledge, the object of learning.

Commonly we think of knowledge as stuff that you remember. However, knowledge isn't stuff and the brain isn't a simple container.

Knowledge represents dynamic connections between neurons. It's about connection and communication. It's important to help learners to construct and connect knowledge through thought, experience, emotion and senses. We'll get into this more later.

## The Virtuous cycle of Learning (VcoL)

Learning in the goldilocks zone (Hard enough to be challenging but not so hard that failure is the common result) triggers the dopamine opioid cycle. Setting your learner objectives in their goldilocks zone will make the learning most engaging.

To set goals in the Goldilocks zone you need to know someone's initial understanding and competency of a certain concept or skill.

![[LXD VCOL.png]]

1.  Set goals - diagnose the goldilocks zone and breaking down learning milestones
2.  Gather information you may need to pursuit the goal and evaluate the quality and usability.
3.  Apply, put knowledge to work with real world risk.
4.  Reflect on the outcome - Do I have evidence that what I did worked. How do I know that I'm not biased?
5.  Reset the learning goal based on the reflections.

Feedback may come from coaches, peers or formative assessment.

# Ch.2 Learning Experience Design Principles

### What exactly does one 'design'?

The four essential parts of learning design are:

-   The Pedagogy
-   The Curriculum
-   The Environment
-   The Assessment

### What are some principle of LXD?

![[LXD Principles.png]]

1.  Learner Centered
2.  Connect the new to the old
3.  Context is king
4.  Leverage the group
5.  Construction
6.  Technology enabled
7.  Content is a servant not a replacement for a teacher
8.  Feedback & reflection
9.  Scaffold knowledge
10.  Identity shift.

### 1\. Learner Centered

Instead of focusing on what you wish your students knew, think about the problems they’re facing and how your course will help. Creating meaningful and effective learning experiences requires us to build empathy with the learner. We must ask questions such as, what professions, backgrounds and demographics do our learners come from? What are their pain points and needs? What are their goals? What would success look like if they overcome those pain points? Use the [learner empathy map](https://lxd.org/news/empathy-map-for-learners-and-learning-experience-design/) and keep your learner at the center of your design process.

### 2\. Connect the old to the new

![[LXD Known Unknown.png]]

The human mind has developed a powerful capacity for analogy. Much of our everyday language describes things in terms of their 'likeness' to others. Learning experience designers and teachers leverage the power of analogy to help the learner make new connections from the known to the unknown.

The effectiveness of this relies on the first principle of learner centered design - Empathy.

### 3\. Context is king

For adult learners, the context for learning is usually their job role or social role. A common practice is to use a recognised problem as the motivation for learning. I urge you to tap into the emotions of the learner in setting your experience's context. You want to harness learners hearts as well as their brains.

Without a sense of the moral, ethical and historical landscape for the consequences of applying or not applying their knowledge, you run the risk of turning your learner's mind into a bookshelf. Adding historical context, future speculations, debating on the relevance the knowledge's impact on human lives will help learners get a wholistic picture of where their knowledge fits into the world. Context is hugely motivating.

### 4\. Leverage the group

Personal growth happens in relationship to others. We're most familiar with FOMO and competition rankings as drivers of learning motivation. Surfacing information about desires, curiosities, inspirations, aspirations allows you to tie learning objectives to social dynamics. Access the wisdom of the crowd with co-operative and group activities to help individuals gain insight through multiple angles of reflection. Teacher's in a classroom are often presented as a single source of truth in a room. Enabling peer-to-peer support gives learners to build convergence on their knowledge and to witness their growth in content to others. Refrain from putting them in a black box and telling them to figure it out.

### 5\. Knowledge Construction

Constructionist learning is when learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. Constructionism advocates student-centred, discovery learning where students use the information they already know to acquire more knowledge. Allow students to learn through participation in project-based learning. When they make mistakes it gives them an opportunity to 'know what they don't know' and recruit knowledge from their overlapping fields of knowledge.

### 6\. Technology enabled

The tools we use govern what's possible to think and create. Technology constrains or enables what knowledge and thoughts a learner can construct. Fire, for example, makes possible thoughts, knowledge and behaviour associated with cooked foods.

Technology can support 'static' information transfer e.g. MOOCS like Udemy and Coursera. It can also support dynamic exploration and risk e.g. VR. Depending on what is being taught, different technologies can support learners to expand on their understanding of the intuitions they gained in visceral experience.

### 7\. **Content is a servant, not a replacement for a teacher**

> Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the product of the activity of learners. — John Holt

![[Novice Expert.png]]

Experience builds understanding. Understanding is less squishy than 'learning'. It's primarily to do with pattern recognition. During a football match The novice sees ten people running around chaotically, the coach sees a series of patterns. 

There are three major differences in their understanding. 

Can learners use mental models to turn disorganized chaos into order and Linked Concepts? Can learners describe how basketball relates to executive team dynamic or even physics?

The best way to get good at public speaking is to stand in front of people and speak. The books and content are supportive but cannot replace the learner's participation.

### 8\. Feedback and reflection

![[Instruction is only 10%.png]]

Instruction is only a small part of good learning experience design. Building ways to offer feedback and reflection are paramount to learner development. You can achieve this through quizzes, formative assessments, 1-1 mentorship, peers. Done correctly feedback and reflection can help a learner to develop their metacognition, the ability to think about their own thinking.

Feedback through analytics shouldn't simply be a diagnosis of what's happening now but analytics at their best can be a doorway of what else is possible. It can reveal to the learner what kinds of connections he or she is making that they might not see yet e.g. types of connections with fellow learners or types of connections across courses and disciplines that they might have an intuition about but might not be fully aware of.

### 9\. Scaffold the learning process

Don’t assume that the learner is equipped for learning this way, provide support. Start with monkey see monkey do. If you've seen the karate kid or any martial arts movie, there's always a video montage of a student starting their process by copying the teacher. Over time he fights with a wooden dummy or swinging punching bag to simulate someone punching back. Next, his master watches over him as he fights another student at a similar skill level. Soon he's fighting enemies alongside his master. Finally, he's off in the world fighting bad guys and winning tournaments. This is a silly example but exemplifies breaking the bigger objective down into smaller steps.

![[LXD Scaffolding.png]]

### 10\. Identity Shift

The brain has been hardwired for storytelling. Much of modern psychology revolves around the notion of archetypes and myths. Help learners to position themselves in their own narratives by leveraging common storytelling themes such as the hero's journey. The point is not to teach science, but instead to teach them to be scientists. This involves not just knowledge of propositions and procedures but the history of the field of science, connecting them to the community of science and its protagonists.

> Knowing an idea is like "knowing a person." Knowing a domain of knowledge is like meeting a "community of people." - Seymour Papert

This deeply ties into the principle of '**context is king'.**

Much of what motivates great learning is inspiration. Ask and observe who your learner's inspirations are. Ask them to articulate the qualities they are attracted to in them. Then ask them why they desire those qualities. Ask why in response to their answers roughly 5 times. You'll begin to uncover what's driving them or begin to see that their identity is made largely by the desires and expectations of their peers.

If you've cared for children or been a child yourself you'd probably remember a conversation like this.

**Child:** Mum my birthday is coming up, can I have the latest toy X

**Mum:** No you can't, besides we already just got you Y

**Child:** Arrrgh, you're so unfair! I want that toy!

**Mum:** Well, you can't have it. Especially not with that attitude.

**Child:** But mooom! Everyone's getting latest toy X. Jenny has one, timmy has it!

Children base a lot of their [identity on what others desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgB9p2BA4fw) as they develop new types of empathy and ways to relate to the world. Being mindful of what developmental stages your learners are at can help you to apply different pedagogical strategies for different ages and motivations.

# Ch.3 Great teaching

COMING SOON - I'm still synthesising my thoughts on this but much is inspired by the work in the great teaching evidence review. A meta-study of research papers and journals.

[Great Teaching Toolkit](https://www.greatteaching.com/)

### 1\. The best way to learn something is to teach it.

![[Learning Pyramid.png]]

-   Explain it to yourself.
-   Explain it to others (good enough to get the idea).
-   Explain it to others (so good that others share it and are willing to pay for more).

Find opportunities for students to practice teaching others. Doing this helps them to identify the gaps in their knowledge and find their own analogies for explaining concepts. 

### 2\. Supporting learners to engage in the 'Hard work'

### 3\. Turning Mystery into Mastery

![[Mystery Mastery.png]]


### 4\. 4\. Support all quadrants & all levels (A.Q.A.L)

![[LXD Integral.png]]

### 5\. Support learner agency - embrace their whole lifeworld.
