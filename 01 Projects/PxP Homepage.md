Please be patient while I migrate my notes from Notion to here.

You're looking through the ever-increasing digital aperture into my mind and personality. This is a place to dive into my rationale 

Much of what I have to say has already been said. I simply re-synthesize it for modern times because people don't hear it. I write and speak passionately, while standing on the shoulders of [these giants](https://www.notion.so/sxhx/Serj-s-Creative-Lineage-7eb7113a0ef64efd81e0681ddf451c85).

### Introduction: Paideia x Praxis

**Paideia** is Greek word with wide ranging connotations. It is broadly about the practice of raising of younger members of society. In modern society, the responsibility of a paideia is often spread across multiple institutions, domains and social groups. Members within families, schools, corporations, medical and therapeutic institutions, caregivers and even law enforcement form and contribute to the broader societal paideia. 

**Praxis** is the exercise or practice of an art, science, or skill. By doing so we turn theory into practical application.
