OUR STUDENTS ARE TEACHERS, ALL TEACHERS ARE STUDENTS, EVERYONE IS A CREATOR

---

It's pretty undisputed that learning to learn, being a critical self-directed lifelong learner is one of the best competencies to develop in our fast paced, ever changing world. Indeed in uncertain times the only truly important skill is to learn, unlearn and adapt.

"Over the next century, scholars and fans aided by computational algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We'll come to understand that no work, no idea, stands truly alone, but that all good true and beautiful things are networks, ecosystems of intertwined parts, related entities and similar works" - **Kevin Kelly - Editor Wired Magazine**

[[Zachery Stein]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Marshal Machluen]] and many other pioneers in educational theory all point to a converging new form of learning configuration. The ecosystem. 

My goal in this note is to synthesize they ideas presented to outline a schema of the proposed system, it's mechanisms, assumptions and finally experiments by which we can reduce risk and uncertainty in the project.  
  
  **Immediately Some High level Co-ordination challenges**
given the complexity and fluidity of this ecosystem approach, effective coordination that ensures equity, safety, and transparency will be paramount. To name a few major ones, areas of coordination will include:**

-   Making all of the opportunities visible and navigable by youth, families, and advisors

# Introduction
What are the barriers and enablers faced by attempts to create or catalyse learning ecosystems?


# Why now

Across the globe there is a growing consensus that education demands radical transformation if we want all citizens to become future-ready in the face of a world that's becoming increasingly more complex. Education has the potential to be the greatest enabler of preparing everyone, young and old, for the future, yet supporting learning too often remains an issue for schools alone.

Talk is a exploration of thinking outside of how individual programs or schools operate.

Exhaustion of the existing educational paradigm Most education systems are struggling to keep pace with the rapid changes in society, the workplace and across the world. They are failing to tackle some of the key issues (Perkins, 2014) of our time, and at worst, are contributing to them. The growing gap between the education systems we have, and what the future needs from education (Facer, 2011; Clayton, et al, 2008) is the burning platform that has sparked a call for a paradigm shift (Robinson, 2010), which learning ecosystems may begin to offer. In many systems (not all), top-down reforms have created a number of perversities, often leading to: • Unprecedented anxieties and stress levels of students widely attributed to high-stakes assessment (OECD, 2015); • Disillusioned and burnt-out teachers facing a loss of professional identity linked to high accountability regimes (National Education Union, 2018) • A tendency of schools and practitioners to avoid risk-taking and therefore quashing the potential for emergent innovative practice (Cisco, 2010).




around the world, and build a wide range of possible new relationships among business, education, government, and community

What happens when young people engage with a range of resources within a broader community, charged with the power of social interaction in the connected-world.

What kinds of learning systems can sense an environment effectively, adapt and reconfigure itself to both the needs of a labour market and an individuals's sense of identity and purpose?

# Ecosystems in Theory vs practice

 a biological metaphor in response to complexity.

 biological ecosystems seem a perfect fit for the change requirements in education 
 
they are metaphorically attractive as a way of thinking about the future because Ecosystems both provide and require:

 ### Diversity: 
 
 Multiple providers that fulfil many roles, allowing for “structural stability” of the ecosystem

 ### Maximum productivity and resource cycling within the ecosystem:
 
 Resources including knowledge, are optimized and distributed so nothing goes to waste.

 ### Dynamic adaptability: 
 
 Ecosystems can adapt and respond to learner needs and changes of institutional environments (this is the critical feature that distinguishes ecosystems from earlier, and more rigid, approaches of ‘partnership’).

 ### Scalability: 
 
 Ecosystems can operate on various scales, from learner groups or specific schools to the planetary 

  It is worth noting that the application of the ecosystem metaphor to fields of human endeavour has a long history in disciplines other than education and learning. Ecosystem as both an analytical tool and a practical strategy has been explored in business and management theory for at least two decades (Moore, 1996) and complexity economics (Beinhocker, 2007) has been gaining ground for around the same period. In each case, the introduction of the ecosystem metaphor has been a response to the limitations of simple market equilibrium models or hierarchies for understanding and shaping systems

  
 Let's explore whether the opportunity exists to create dynamic, diverse and evolving learning ecosystems which enable all young people to be lifelong learners, leveraging a broader and more powerful range of assets than ever before. Such a reconfiguration of education systems and our collective mindset promise to create the conditions for more dynamic and powerful collaborations which stimulate and enable innovation.


Thinking ‘system’ (not just isolated innovations) is clearly imperative; but the concept of ‘system’ needs to be rethought too. If the promise of local learning ecosystems is to be realized, then system leaders at jurisdiction levels will need to reposition themselves so that rather than being primarily providers of education, they intentionally create a platform for a diversity of players, and offer vision, stewardship and enablement to this (Global Education Leaders’ Partnership, 2013).

The term ‘system’ can have negative connotations because of its association with top-down reforms, which have limitations even in successful systems. In this vision, ecosystems can enable collaboration and innovation without bureaucratic and/or market control: they may become horizontal, or bottom-up.

Municipalities (education providers) are given free reign to do whatever they like. Teachers are seen as experts


### Innovation ecosystems and learning ecosystems

# What is a learning ecosystem

Deriving from the field of evolutionary biology, an ‘ecosystem’ is a community of interdependent organisms acting in conjunction with the natural environment.

There are obviously already ecosystems which are netoworks of schools alone, or involve partnerships between schools, community and industry by are controlled wholly by the school  but our focus is on ecosystems that have a few common features 

• Are diversifying learning resources and pathways for learners 
• Are activating and sharing resources for learning in new ways from diverse sources 
• Are dynamic in composition and porous around the edges 
• Are supported by helpful infrastructure 
• Comprise formal and informal learning institutions, traditional and new entrants 
• Have distributed governance 
• Are learner driven or have learner agency at their heart 
• Make an attempt to meet twenty first century challenges in some way, beyond academic attainment.

### 3 Types of Ecosystem - A Topology 
not mutually exclusive.

#### Knowledge sharing ecosystems 

operating at global or national level

This type of ecosystem comprises complex, evolving networks of organizations including think tanks, foundations, governmental and global agencies and others who are consciously connecting to facilitate the sharing of new knowledge about education and learning, innovation, funding opportunities, and more. It is largely concerned with building the global shared knowledge base, scaling innovation and enabling the better use of resources and opportunities to tackle shared global learning challenges, not only within but between networks.

#### Innovation Ecosystems 

operating at city or jurisdictional level

Some cities and regions are involved in designing deliberate conditions that drive and accelerate radical innovation - such as new designs for schooling - through the combination of multiple players, policies and platforms. These innovation ecosystems tend to contain traditional and new education providers, formal and informal learning opportunities, the involvement of business, edtech developers and providers and higher education, and are supported by digital technology.

#### Learning ecosystems

operating at city or local level

Learning ecosystems comprise diverse combinations of providers (schools, businesses, community organizations as well as government agencies) creating new learning opportunities and pathways to success. They are usually supported by an innovative credentialing system or technology platforms that replace or augment the traditional linear system of examinations and graduation. They need not, however, be confined to their geographic location in terms of resources overall. They may exploit the technologies now available to choreograph global learning resources, if they do that then they can be thought of as 'global'

This will be the focus for my presentation today.

Features 

Learning ecosystems are a possible, though not guaranteed, product of an innovation ecosystem.

learning ecosystems focus exclusively on delivering powerful, often radically diverse, learning experiences for young people

# The Challenges that Ecosystems 

What are the barriers and enablers faced by attempts to create or catalyse learning ecosystems?

Do real-world learning ecosystems really represent a new learning paradigm, as described in the literature?

#### 1. The exhaustion of the existing educational paradigm, on its own terms; 

Exhaustion of the existing educational paradigm Most education systems are struggling to keep pace with the rapid changes in society, the workplace and across the world. They are failing to tackle some of the key issues (Perkins, 2014) of our time, and at worst, are contributing to them. The growing gap between the education systems we have, and what the future needs from education (Facer, 2011; Clayton, et al, 2008) is the burning platform that has sparked a call for a paradigm shift (Robinson, 2010), which learning ecosystems may begin to offer. In many systems (not all), top-down reforms have created a number of perversities, often leading to: • Unprecedented anxieties and stress levels of students widely attributed to high-stakes assessment (OECD, 2015); • Disillusioned and burnt-out teachers facing a loss of professional identity linked to high accountability regimes (National Education Union, 2018) • A tendency of schools and practitioners to avoid risk-taking and therefore quashing the potential for emergent innovative practice (Cisco, 2010).


#### 2. The need for a shift in purpose in the context of rapid, fundamental change 

Shift in purpose Writers who have taken a holistic view of a wide and profound set of purposes for education often see ecosystems as part of the solution for delivering these (Hannon & Peterson, 2017; Fadel, et al, 2015). For instance, GEF locates the need for learning ecosystems in a world view of a fundamentally transformed human project, one that includes, but isn’t limited to an entirely altered set of values and relationships to the planet. They see learning ecosystems as capable of compensating for broader failures of public policies, and acting as a pathway to social transformation. 

> “Education can become an avenue through which global society may overcome the gaps and barriers we have created: the digital divide, the imbalance of information flows, the growing economic and social inequality, religious, ethical, and cultural divides, and extreme ecological pressures we are placing on Earth.” Global Education Futures report, 2018


#### 3. The need for a new organizational paradigm to deliver this shift.

Other questions arise around the extent to which learning ecosystems emerge naturally in response to conditions of twenty-first century connectivity, or whether they require intentional design. It seems that this apparent tension between ‘tight’ design and control on the one hand, and desire for ‘loose’ distributed, organic and dynamic processes on the other, might be central to our understanding of the success of learning ecosystems to deliver on outcomes and the role they might play in challenging or replacing the existing paradigm of organised learning.

To better understand the barriers and enablers to learning ecosystems let's look at the 

governance 
funding arrangements, 
new roles for people and organisations
the role of context and place

 a question to be explored in the future, as local learning ecosystems develop and mature, will be: how resilient are they to the removal of initial catalytic funding, the entry of dysfunctional members or other unanticipated shifts in the environment?

# Frameworks for 

### 1- Stages of learning ecosystem 

We can think of learning ecosystems being shaped by four stages through which 
they  develop and grow: 

hypothesis and visioning, 
catalysing and initiating, 
dynamic experimentation, and 
mainstreaming or sustaining. 

 At each stage there are questions and dilemmas that an ecosystem might meet
 

### 2- Impact of learning ecosystems on existing learning provision

a movement towards learning ecosystems has the potential to transform how learning happens.

 Across all the cases you can think of the impact that an ecosystem willl have on existing provisions on two axes. In doing so, four broad categories of learning ecosystems have been discerned:
 
 1. Expanded formal offers designed with pre-determined curricula and/or outcomes; 
 2. Industry or community led initiatives where the skills requirements of a group from outside education (e.g. an industry sector) leads them to put in place conditions to enable new learning pathways and opportunities that meet the industry’s need; 
 3. New designs and new platforms where a high degree of learner agency meets intentional design and results in new wholesale designs for organised learning. 4
 4. Responsively dynamic where learner agency meets a dynamic and self-sustaining community of providers eager to support and enhance learning.
