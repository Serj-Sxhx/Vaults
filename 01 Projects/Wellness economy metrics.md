See [[Perennial Problems]]

This is a public voice tool. It's a review system like Google map's 5 star and comment review system. People can navigate a map and review businesses based on how that business exacerbates or supports them to overcome the [[Perennial Problems]]

At the moment this can be wildly gamed, so stage one is a self report survey tool to identify to what degree the perennial problems have an effect on a person in a certain context.

Later on complex models of psychological value as distinct from functional, social and monetary might be more easily quantifiable leading to new forms of token. 

If the survey is accurate it may also lead to better allocation of resources, support and care. If the negative psychological impacts of certain social system, business, families or any context is made legible via surveys of this nature, it maybe be possible to deploy, mental health professionals, therapists, counselors, and social designers.
