OUR STUDENTS ARE TEACHERS, ALL TEACHERS ARE STUDENTS, EVERYONE IS A CREATOR

---

The social network for self-directed, lifelong learners.

"What if school, as we used it on a daily basis, signaled not the name of a process or institution through which we could be indoctrinated, not a structure through which social capital was grasped and policed, but something more organic, like a scale of care. what if school was the scale at which we could care for each other and move together. In my view, at this moment in history, that is really what we need to learn most urgently."

- Alexis Pauline Gumbs: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine mammals
