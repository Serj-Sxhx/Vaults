Please be patient while I migrate my notes from Notion to here.

You're looking through the ever-increasing digital aperture into my mind and personality. This is a place to dive into my rationale 

Much of what I have to say has already been said. I simply re-synthesize it for modern times because people don't hear it or forget. I write and speak passionately, while standing on the shoulders of [these giants](https://www.notion.so/sxhx/Serj-s-Creative-Lineage-7eb7113a0ef64efd81e0681ddf451c85).

### Introduction: Paideia X Praxis

**Paideia** is Greek word with wide ranging connotations. It is broadly about the practice of raising of younger members of society. In modern society, the responsibility of a paideia is often spread across multiple institutions, domains and social groups. Members within families, schools, corporations, medical and therapeutic institutions, caregivers and even law enforcement form and contribute to the broader societal paideia. 

**Praxis** is the exercise or practice of an art, science, or skill. By doing so we turn theory into practical application.

The title is a bit of a wordplay with a double meaning. 

The first meaning is invoked by pronouncing the intermediate X as 'eX' of the Latin root suffix meaning 'out'. This is to point to a central problem that the work here aims to address. That we don't have an optimal or shared common Praxis for raising children. From the taboo of parenting in western culture, to the broader manipulative technological and economic forces that mold their psychology. 

The second is arrive at by noting the X as a multiply symbol. Here the Paideia is amplified by a shared community of practice.

** Central Themes to my research**
_Still moving notes from Notion - Open theses for each core theme coming soon_

**🔍 Why Ed-Tech has failed to disrupt the classroom and alternate approaches to designing & deploying.**

**🔍 Adaptive & high agency learners by supporting [[Learning power]]**

**🔍 Cross cultural anthropological studies on human development, learning networks and communities of practice.**

**🔍 Intergenerational & Inter-Org Knowledge - What can we learn from the longest enduring organisations? What and whose knowledge should be preserved and passed on to future generations / How and why will it be taught?**

**🔍 Scenius, Matchmaking and Crowdsource Problem Solving - What teaching, learning and relating is best to foster scenius? What technologies will help us solve problems together, co-ordinate, learn together and develop our collective intelligence?**
