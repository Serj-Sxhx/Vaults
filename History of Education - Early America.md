Jasonian democracy - You give every white man above 21 a vote. This is different to birthright and land. 

Who the hell are these 21 year olds. What is going to happen if we give these people political power? What's their level of competence?

Do you need to work to produce citizens of a certain competence? What role does a systematic education have in that? 

There's no school but there's high literacy rates. They're reading politically charged newspapers which are being distributed. Wide spread intellectualism in the culture. Debate is changing from a gentleman's monopoly to a "civil rhetoric"

What's good to know when it's a frontier and unstable violence from place to place and frontier to frontier.
