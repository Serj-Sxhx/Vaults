# Live Call Notes 

- Huns cause trouble in the east of the roman empire at Constantinople
- Roman empire spits into eastern empire as the bynsantine empire
- The west is captured by a germanic king
- The 400 - 500 AD starts the dark ages

Why are the dark ages so dark
- loss of agricultural knowledge
- Huge population loss - about 50%, dramatic in urban centres
- pax romana ends - If you molested someone from rome they would send an army and crack down, without this peace trade decrease
- If trade decreases then the merchants moving around writing, literacy and papyrus and books disappear.
- Roman empire is replaced by non-literate cultures.
- 500-600-700 AD a letter to a feudal lord asking the monastery asking for 
- In dark ages, literacy is stigmatised and theres no point in getting an education but in roman empire, lower classes and upper would want it because it was useful
- huge reset in the culture, breakdowns of law and the reasons to get education decline.

Roman Catholic Institutionalisation
- It's not a religion thats passed via oral tradition or set of practices that has to do with worshiping your ancestors.
- he argues that christianity is a doctrinal religion of the book.
- This text, the bible is maintained by a central authority the roman catholic church
- The leaders of this religion need some kind of education to be around it
	- You need to understand latin and make judgements on the content of the book
- It's slightly helenistic in that, memorise the bible, then you understand it after you lear latin. 
- Augustine defines the bible - what really is the bible and what should be interpreted literally and when it should be read figuratively.

Interpretatio Christiana
- How to adapt the christian beliefs to the local traditions if you go into it.

- Education becomes primarily monastic, and central to joining the church and wanting to participate in the Roman Catholic Heirachy

In southern Italy there was a school called Celerno which is a medical school. 
- they do hands on learning how to dissect bugs and help patients.
- You could do rhetoric and study literature.

There was a Guild and apprenticeship system but no one could replicate the technologies of civil engineers. It was passed on orally to continue to trades.


### Capella 

Somehow survives the dark ages- He's not innovating, he's reporting.

Seven liberal arts 
- Grammar - 
- Dialectic - Logic & Argument via Aristotle 30 page summary

-
- Geometry

- Astronomy
- Harmony 

The content

- Mercury wants to marry and asks apollo and he suggest to marry Philology the love of learning
- Very pagan text 
- It's a personified different subjects 
- It's a funny witty and strange approach to influence and encyclopaedia and textbook of what you should learn. 

12th Century is when law and towns are making a come back and the emergence of higher education.
Euclid and Aristotle is being imported from Arabic World

University means Union - There were learning clubs in paris
A killer teacher e.g. Avolard, 
Can we pay you tuition but you don't come to every lecture.

Economic expansion
Superstar teachers
Need to be more organised a union of students so they become institutionalised.

**Innovations**

There are classes on a daily basis. 

Point, counterpoint pedagogy e.g. Avolard

The Rise of university - the book

When they're learning they're reading a text out in class and commenting on the text. 

This is better than bible school 

It's expository 
Studying roman law
Primary source
And applied rhetoric and debate
Expanded corpus
Some kind of eye to practical application

Drawbacks?

It's bookish, you study old works
Not by experimentation 

It's side by side with religious institutions.
 
Arts philosophy
Theology 
Law
Oral Exams


What this degree let you do was teach
Master of arts lets you teach.
But this is mostly status.

They all started as learning clubs.
