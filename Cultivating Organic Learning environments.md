by a radical Catholic priest named Ivan

Illich who decided that he wanted to

calculate the true speed of a car and he

said in order to calculate the true

speed of a car you can't just take the

distance that the car travels and divide

it by the time that it takes to get

there you also have to take into account

the time that you have to work in order

to afford the car and the time that you

have to sit in traffic in order to get

to work and so on and so forth then well

he found was that once you internalize

all these externalities the true speed

of a car is around five kilometers an

hour walking speed and this is crazy and

it's important and he used this as a

center he used this as an illustrative

example of a philosophy that he called

counter productivity where he said that

technologies tend to bring efficiencies

up until a certain point of application

and beyond that point of application

they tend to bring inefficiencies in

exactly the opposite direction of the

purpose for which they were intended and

this is true not just for automobiles

but lots of things from antibiotics to

emails and I think I think about this a

lot because I make technologies and I'd

like them to do what I like them to do

and I think the problem is not in

technology per se but in the kind of

technologies that we tend to build we

tend to build the technologies whose use

leads to more use I call these self

reinforcing technologies and the car is

a great example of that the car allows

for centralization of work and the

creation of suburbs and highways which

then makes the car necessary which then

clogs the highways and you know that

you're an in Detective spiral when the

solution is more of the same more

highways

or cars but we can imagine creating a

different kind of technology instead of

creating self-reinforcing technologies

we can create self-limiting technologies

technologies that kick-start a human

process that once it gets going is no

longer so dependent on the technology

itself in other words instead of

creating technologies whose use leads to

more use we can create technologies

whose use leads to less use and there's

glimmers of technologies like this today

a great example is an online dating site

if it works you don't need to use it

anymore so I started thinking about this

in earnest a few years ago when I was

living in San Francisco and I noticed

that all of a sudden there seemed to be

food trucks everywhere I was like why

are there so many food trucks and why

now and so I started asking around and

it turned out that it was because of

Twitter you see it was difficult to get

a food trucks license at the time in San

Francisco but with Twitter illegal food

trucks could thrive because they parked

in a different spot every day and tweet

out where they were

at a certain point the legal food trucks

caught wind of this took a look at the

followers of the illegal food trucks and

said this is a food truck customer

database and so they started following

the followers of the illegal food trucks

who followed them back in this vibrant

community formed around food trucks and

this community work together to to

change the regulations in San Francisco

putting even more food trucks on the

street and so this was fascinating to me

because this was the internet shaping

physical space it was software shaping

the city or to be more precise it was

software kick-starting a social process

that in turn shaped the city and food

trucks are the cheapest and easiest way

to shape a city so if it's happening

with food trucks now it's likely gonna

happen with lots of other things in the

future and so what a great opportunity

if you have a vision for the city to

start help shaping it via software so I
