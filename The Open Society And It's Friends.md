In his "Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto," the late Aaron Swartz, an activist and Internet prodigy, passionately argued for universal access to knowledge, a sentiment that echoes the principles laid down by philosopher Karl Popper in his seminal work, "The Open Society and Its Enemies." Popper championed the idea of a society where knowledge and ideas are exchanged freely, without barriers, as a way to spur innovation, creativity, and human progress. Swartz's manifesto further extrapolated this to the realm of digital information, advocating for open access to scholarly and scientific resources.

## Progress Through Openness

The importance of progress is a shared theme in both Swartz's manifesto and Popper's philosophy. The idea that knowledge should be available to all, without any form of discrimination, has been the driving force behind movements like decentralized science and open innovation. These movements have spurred breakthroughs that would not have been possible in a closed, controlled system.

Decentralized science, for instance, has facilitated unprecedented collaborations among researchers worldwide. It's become possible to collectively tackle global challenges, like climate change and pandemics, that are beyond the scope of any single institution or country. Open innovation, on the other hand, has democratized the creative process, enabling anyone with an idea to contribute to technological and social progress.

## The Unjust Persecution of Whistleblowers

Swartz himself was a casualty of the system he fought against, and his story is not unique. In recent years, we've seen numerous instances where democratic societies have persecuted whistleblowers and truth-tellers, in stark contradiction to the principles of an open society.

Edward Snowden exposed the mass surveillance of citizens by the U.S. National Security Agency. Julian Assange, through WikiLeaks, revealed war crimes and government corruption. Reality Winner leaked documents highlighting Russian interference in the U.S. 2016 election. Daniel Hale shed light on the U.S.'s covert drone program. Lastly, Chelsea Manning unveiled the harsh realities of the Iraq War through leaked diplomatic cables and military logs.

These examples demonstrate that even democratic societies can resort to tactics reminiscent of the oppressive regimes they claim to oppose. And they highlight the urgency of our struggle for an open society, where truth-telling is celebrated rather than punished.

## Building Decentralized and Uncensorable Technology with IPFS

Decentralized, uncensorable technology is a powerful tool that can resist systemic oppression by operating beyond the control of any single entity. In this digital frontier, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) stands as a beacon of hope.

IPFS is a peer-to-peer network protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. It fundamentally changes the way data is stored and retrieved, shifting from location-based addressing (where you ask for a file from a specific location) to content-based addressing (where you ask for a file based on what it is). This makes the IPFS inherently resistant to censorship—if one node is shut down, the content it hosts can still be accessed from any other node that holds a copy.

Using IPFS for creating decentralized applications (dApps) carries multiple benefits. Firstly, it ensures data permanence, meaning that once data is uploaded to the IPFS network, it remains there indefinitely, accessible to anyone who needs it.

Secondly, it promotes data integrity. When data is stored on IPFS, it's given a unique fingerprint (a cryptographic hash) that ensures the content you access hasn't been tampered with.

Thirdly, IPFS enables data distribution at scale. Traditional centralized servers often struggle with high demand, leading to slower speeds or even crashes. IPFS, on the other hand, allows for content to be delivered from the nearest node, making the network more resilient and efficient.

The development and adoption of such decentralized technologies, like IPFS, can challenge the current model of information control, paving the way for a truly open and free internet—a critical component of the open society Aaron Swartz and Karl Popper envisioned.

## Honouring Aaron’s Legacy Through Positive-Sum Friendships and Alternative Infrastructures

Honouring Swartz's legacy requires us to not only advocate for an open society, but to actively create it. This involves you going out and networking 100 positive-sum friend and building alternative infrastructures that support living and human flourishing.

Positive-sum friendships refer to relationships where all parties benefit, where each interaction adds value rather than detracting from it. Keeping such friends around you is crucial for multiple reasons. Firstly, they provide a supportive network that can help you navigate through challenges and setbacks. Secondly, they contribute diverse perspectives and skills, enriching the collective problem-solving process. Finally, these friendships can spark collaborations that have far-reaching impact, creating a ripple effect of positive change.

This network of positive-sum friends is not just about the people, but also about the projects they undertake. The future belongs to many small, highly leveraged groups working on building alternative infrastructures that challenge the status quo. These groups are designing solutions that are more equitable, sustainable, and conducive to human flourishing.

Take, for instance, the creation of decentralized applications that resist censorship, or the establishment of community-led renewable energy projects that democratize access to power. Or consider the development of open-source learning platforms that revolutionize education, making it more accessible and tailored to individual needs. These are but a few examples of the transformative potential of such small, highly leveraged groups.

 Live together, share food together, be challenged together and don't allow the deplatforming of a charismatic genius set you back. We can create the kind of open society that Swartz envisioned, where information is free, opportunities are accessible, and human potential is fully realized. This is not only a fitting tribute to Swartz's legacy but also a vital step towards a more just and vibrant future. 

## A Call to Action

In conclusion, it is pertinent to recall the words of futurist and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller: "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." The existing reality is one of information control and surveillance, of whistleblowers being silenced and persecuted.

Instead of fighting this reality, we must strive to build a new one. A reality that embraces the principles of an open society, where knowledge is free, truth is protected, and innovation is unbounded. We must leverage technologies like IPFS to create decentralized applications that resist censorship. We must foster networks of positive-sum friends, committed to building alternative infrastructures that promote human flourishing.

This is not just a call to action—it's an invitation to dream and to dare. An invitation to shape a future where the free flow of information is the norm, not the exception; where power is shared, not concentrated; where each of us can contribute to the betterment of society.

This future won't be handed to us; we must build it, brick by brick, line of code by line of code, relationship by relationship.

The task may seem monumental, even insurmountable, but remember: change often starts small, with a single step, a single voice, a single idea. So let us take that step, raise the voices of the suppressed,   our ideas. For in doing so, we can transform the world—one open access at a time.
