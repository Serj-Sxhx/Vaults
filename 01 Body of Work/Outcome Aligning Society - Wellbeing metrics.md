# Context

One measure of the health of an economy is whether businesses are in alignment with their customers. We can see whether sales and spending figures match up with long-term satisfaction ratings, with customers' health, and with other measurements of well-being.

Our now pervasive and ambient epidemics of obesity, social isolation, depression, and lack of meaningful work indicates that these measure are deeply misaligned.

# The Challenge

To outcome-align our society would require both

(a) detecting when and how best our true interests are satisfied, and

(b) either reshaping traffic / sales or otherwise changing incentives for businesses and organizations to match those reports of long-term satisfaction.

While current measurements of wellbeing such as the [OECD metrics](https://www.oecd.org/statistics/measuring-well-being-and-progress.htm) are good, they don't offer those being measured with actionable ways to seek support or use that data to vote, bargain or take action against those sources that negatively impact their wellbeing.

Can we tether the lifeblood of our economy—cashflow, attention, and resources—to reports of informed and fulfilled lives?

# Solution:

**Perennial Problems psychometric assessment survey.**

`User flow`

-   A citizen logs into the app on their smartphone.
-   Periodically / given a context? / or event? / they are prompted to fill out the survey.
-   They answer a 1 most unlike me to 5 most like me style survey with x questions.
-   A spider diagram report is produced which shows the depth of suffering in each particular perennial problems given the survey answers.
-   The report can be used as a point of discussion between the user, their community or specialised therapists to diagnose what practices and support they might need.
-   The data can be shared (Anonymously???) as open source information for local communities, policy makers, economists, civic technologists and others to draw insights from and better align economic products and services.

### Going further

With this data people can then decide as a society how to disincentivize businesses from leading us into activities we regret.

Would people then work together to create the best outcomes for one another—in much the same way they currently collaborate to generate sales, clicks, and views?

There may also be a transition from marketplaces that are mostly about transactions to marketplaces for personal outcomes, and means redirecting attention and cashflow towards providers and sites that produce the best outcomes, best livelihoods, and lowest costs in users' lives, rather than those with viral loops, network effects, marketing deals, or other advantages.
