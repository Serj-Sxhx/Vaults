Understanding is a complex cognitive process that allows individuals to comprehend, analyze, and apply information in diverse situations.

This essay presents my account of Understanding, which comprises of three aspects of understanding which constrain and afford each-other: Interpretation, Inference, and Convergence. They are not distinct or linear. By examining each aspect, I’m aiming to offer learners, educators, assessment designers and policy makers, a framework for thinking about strategies to support the deepening of understanding in any domain. I hope these can act as trailheads for conversations on how to re-design current assessment practice to include broader aspects of what it means to be human — specifically in this essay, what it means to know.

Much of this and following essays in this series is a synthesis of the work of [Dr. John Verveake](https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/john-vervaeke), [Karl Popper](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/), [Ruth Crick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruth-crick-53b3159/) and [Zach Stein](http://www.zakstein.org/).

# My Concern

My fear after speaking to many secondary public and private school teachers who’s performance and guarantee of income to feed their families is measured by their ability to get as many students high grades on standardised tests, is this: A large percentage of our teachers cant give me a clear account of what it means to understand something and substitute cultivating it for delivering on exams results. A smaller percentage do have an account but can’t act on it within the context of school and universities. Without a clear account of what understanding is and how to increase or deepen it, it will be hard to know how to support a learner’s development and thus lead our society astray with misguided citizens who don’t know how to know.

All of this is exacerbated by optimising education systems around assessment infrastructure which measures a narrow or unclear definition of understanding. This combined with stressed teachers and funding cuts is a recipe for disaster. One which is playing out in-front of us right now in the mental health of teachers and students, the lack of meaning in work and at home, and our collective inability to solve our global and local challenges.

# Aspect 1 — Interpretation: Basic Understanding

Interpretation involves building and using mental models to bring order to seemingly chaotic information. At this level, a learner can identify patterns, structures, and relationships within a specific context.

Building mental models is not a linear process. Even when someone has achieved deep understanding of a topic, they might return to the intial mental models they created and modify or update them based on insights from aspects 2 and 3. Aspect 1 is iterative in nature.

Refining mental models over time is a constant process.

_Example: In a game of chess, a beginner may see a chaotic arrangement of pieces on the board, while an experienced player can discern patterns and strategies at play._

To hi-light the iterative nature of Aspect 1…

_Example: In learning a new language, a student might initially struggle to comprehend grammar rules and vocabulary. As they revisit these concepts over time, their understanding gradually deepens, highlighting the iterative nature of the Interpretation aspect._

# Aspect 2 — Inference: Intermediate Understanding

Inference is the ability to relate mental models from one context to another using analogy, comparison, and contrast. A learner at this stage can identify similarities, differences, and shared deep structures between models in different contexts and draw meaningful implications from those comparisons.

This stage may be influenced by emotions, motivation, and cultural factors that shape understanding, sometimes leading to biased or constrained interpretations.

_Example: A musician trained in classical music might be able to recognize similarities and differences in composition and structure when listening to jazz or other genres, allowing them to make connections and appreciate new styles of music._

To hi-light the point on emotions, motivation and cultural factors shaping understanding…

_Example: A historian studying the political climate of two different eras may unconsciously allow their personal biases, emotions, or cultural background to influence their comparison, resulting in a less objective analysis._

# Aspect 3 — Convergence: Deep Understanding

Convergence is the capacity to validate, support, and strengthen mental models using multiple lines of reasoning. A learner at this stage can apply their models across various contexts and build convergence, ultimately increasing their conviction in the accuracy and explanatory power of their understanding.

some disciplines may require additional cognitive processes or methods to achieve a truly deep understanding. It is essential to recognise that certain disciplines may necessitate additional or alternative approaches to truly grasp their complexities.

For instance, abstract domains like philosophy, ethics, or certain branches of theoretical mathematics may involve reasoning that is less reliant on the gathering of converging evidence and more focused on critical thinking, introspection, debate, or the exploration of abstract concepts. In such cases, the Convergence stage as described in the framework may not be entirely sufficient or applicable, as it may not account for these additional cognitive processes.

_Example: A scientist conducting research on climate change might seek converging evidence from multiple disciplines, such as meteorology, oceanography, and biology, to build a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon._

Acknowledging the need to engage a breadth of cognitive processeses…

_Example: A philosopher attempting to reach a deep understanding of an abstract concept might need to rely more on critical thinking, introspection, and dialogue than simply seeking converging evidence, as the Convergence stage suggests._

# Wrapping Up & Design Questions:

By breaking down understanding into Interpretation, Inference, and Convergence, and considering the effects of iterative model creation, emotions, motivation, cultural factors, and domain-specific complexities, learners can better grasp how to develop their skills and knowledge in various domains.

It is important to recognize that all levels of understanding — Interpretation, Inference, and Convergence — might be influenced by emotions, motivation, and cultural factors.

These elements can shape our understanding through the introduction of biases and constrained interpretations. For example, emotional investment in a particular belief may hinder our ability to objectively evaluate conflicting evidence, while cultural factors might predispose us to certain interpretations of information.

As learners and critical thinkers, being aware of these influences allows us to actively counteract potential biases and strive for a more objective and well-rounded understanding.

As for pedagogical implications, this framework can inform educators on designing more effective teaching strategies tailored to the different stages of understanding. By addressing the specific needs of learners at each stage and incorporating the additional cognitive processes required for deep understanding, educators can create a more engaging and supportive learning environment. Furthermore, the framework encourages teachers to consider the role of emotions, motivation, and cultural factors in shaping understanding, leading to more inclusive and culturally sensitive approaches in the classroom.

I believe that in the current assessment landscape of SATs, GCSEs, A-levels, IBs the theory of understanding is quite different to my account. I’d love to meet more people in assessment organisations to ask them what their account of understanding is, and if they believe that their tests are valid in assessing that.

My closing question to assessment designers is, how might assessment be redesigned to incorporate this account of understanding and provide feedback to learners on how they can deepen it?

# An Invitation for Tea

We’re innovating across all 4 pillars of an education system at my organisation, [City as a School](https://www.cityasaschool.com/). Pedagogy, Curriculum, Environment and Assessment — We want to redesign it all from the ground up. If you see synergy, let’s discuss over tea.

If you’re a system redesigner, reach out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-hunt/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Serjhunt_ARK) to Join the City as a School slack channel.

If you’re in the UK come to our ‘[London Learning Exchange’](https://llxchange.org/) meetups on Thursdays to meet other founders, policy, school leaders and builders in Education.

Want to critique and redesign the institutions at play in the world. [Run a Radical Redesign Event.](https://cityasaschool.notion.site/Radical-Redesign-e8c54b9e8cc44512ad6b572c1752360c)
