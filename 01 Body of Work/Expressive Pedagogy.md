# Expressive Pedagogy: Maximizing Time Well Spent in Moral Development

There are many theories of moral development but none 

In a world of hard choices, how do we help navigate the sea of decisions they'll encounter as they grow? Introducing Expressive Pedagogy, a theory rooted in the work of Ruth Chang, which aims to maximize time well spent for children and adolescents by guiding them in understanding their values while exploring different social games.

Before beginning. A few points.

- What you call values probably aren't values but that's okay we just need to agree on semantics. 
- There are no objective values. This theory assumes values pluralism. 
- Schools aren't the only institution or environments that help learners to articulate and live by their values. In fact they might even be one of the worst places to develop character. 
- Ads sell more than products, they sell ideals, norms and expectations which might 'crowd out' our values.
- The rate at which we're having self reflective moments may be about orders of magnitude higher in built and virtual environments than in the classroom. Which could be measured by some kind of standardised unit of time say 2hz in class vs 30hz walking down the high street.

### The Illusion of Scientific Comparisons

Many try to apply scientific comparisons to moral choices, boiling options down to three outcomes: equal, greater, or lesser. In reality, moral choices are complex and can't be reduced to such simplistic terms. Choices like deciding between a yoga class, a music lesson, or gymnastics often involve countless lines of reasoning.

### Values as Attentional Policies

What guides our attention in these moments of choice? Our values. Values serve as attentional policies. 

A short phrase which an agent can remind themselves of, or bring to bear, on the choice, to focus attention on what they find meaningful.

Attending to those things would reduce the regret in a choice and increase 

'Time well spent': A ratio metric of the time spent living by your values vs. living in regretful choices. A we can minimize regret and maximize time spent living by our values.

What is a value: In this case, a value is an attentional policy -- something which an agent can remind themselves of or bring to bear on the choice, which helps them to focus their attention on what they find meaningful. Where attending to those things would reduce the regret in a choice and increase time well spent, which is defined as the percentage of time spent living by your values vs. living in regretful choices.

### Expressive Pedagogy in Action

Expressive Pedagogy seeks to help children develop morally by understanding their values and learning how to apply them in various social games. One roadblock? The limited number of social games available in traditional school settings. As a result, children may internalize school norms and never fully individuate from them.

To counter this, we must expose children to a diverse array of social games and provide ample time for reflection. This empowers them to develop their moral and behavioral character while increasing their time well spent.

### Why "Expressive Pedagogy"?

The term itself emphasizes the importance of helping children discover their values through reflection. But how can we ensure that choices and self-proclaimed values are authentic and not merely internalized social norms?

### Practices for Authentic Choice

To decouple authentic values from internalized norms, consider these strategies:

1.  **On My Own Terms**: Encourage children to redefine success in their own terms.
2.  **Transition Stories**: Share stories of people who transitioned from one path to another, emphasizing the importance of personal values.
3.  **Meaningless Time Journaling**: Track time spent on activities that don't align with personal values to help identify areas for improvement.
4.  **Guessing Game**: Engage children in guessing games that explore their values and preferences.
5.  **Emotions to Values**: Help children connect their emotions to their values to better understand their motivations.
6.  **Field Tripping**: Expose children to different environments, cultures, and social games to expand their horizons and understanding of their values.

By implementing Expressive Pedagogy, we can help children make authentic choices, develop their moral character, and maximize their time well spent in a world full of hard choices.

### Context and Construction

Whats the goal of this piece?
To explicate the basis for a theory of moral development and point to a design practice that education system designers can adopt to support the development of character in the people they serve. The reader should leave understanding how an individual develops 'character' through a process of refining their 'values' by the process I outline.

TL:DR 

People have debated 
What values are, 
if they're teachable, 
if schools should play a part in cultivating specific values or be values neutral, 
how values are cultivated in an individual. This last question is the focus of this essay

There'

Montessoris pedagogy is has a position on what values lead to a meaning full life, and creates norms in the classroom which support practice of these values. It makes it easier to practice X Y Z and not A B C 

Non obvious takes that this the
- What you call values probably aren't values but that's okay we just need to agree on semantics. 
- There are no objective values. Values plurality is a really helpful position for the kind of moral development I argue for. 
- Schools aren't the only institution or environments that help learners to articulate and live by their values. In fact they might even be one of the worst places to develop character. 
- Ads sell more than products, they sell ideals, norms and expectations which might 'crowd out' our values.
- The rate at which we're having self reflective moments may be about orders of magnitude higher in built and virtual environments than in the classroom. Which could be measured by some kind of standardised unit of time say 2hz in class vs 30hz walking down the high street.
- 

What is virtue?
Designing for goals
Designing for emotions
Why are traditional design methods inadequate?
What are values?
	It all starts with attention
Value pluralism
- There are contexts to be honest, times to be ruthless
- Are there objective values?
- There might be clusters of overlapping and adjacet values. We might be able to call these clusters archetypes. But like the elephant in the buddhist parabel we'll only ever touch one part of it. But together we can piece together a more complete picture of these invisible structures if we communicate. 
- We spend alot of time thinking of goals but not thinking about our sources of meaning.

In this article I want to explain how character is developed in an individual through an ongoing process of reflecting on our personal values as we move through social games and interfaces.

I'll touch on how failing to design for values results in depression, loss of agency, and disengagement. I'll point to practices we can adopt as pedagogues and system designers to support Maximise an individual's Time well spent' 

Time well spent: The time spent living by an individual's self defined sources of meaning arrived at through reflection.

Certain topics I'll skim through as i'm trying to get to the meat of my argument which is the implications for thinking in these terms for education. If you ever want to go deeper on any of these topics I've linked to the text book that these ideas are fully explicated in  ['Values-based social Design'](www.google.com)

What are values, what they are not.

Okay so we know that values are attentional policies which we're all not very articulate about. 


# Choice making and social games

When we're faced with the choice of what to buy, or what social games

- [[Ruth Chang]] Hard choices - We try to apply scientific calculus to moral dilemmas. The problem with this is that this mathematical comparison can only result in 3 states. More than, equal to less than. 
- Moral calculus is not like this. We can construct infinite combinations of logic when weighing or comparing questions such as, Should I attend by step-brother's house warming party or stay at home and tend to my elderly mother who's only visiting for the weekend? 
- 
- Or in our monthly retrospective meeting with senior managment, shall I be intellectually honest about the challenges we're facing as a team, or do I want to approach with a curiocity as to the problems. 

In both cases you could construct cohesive logic to justify attending to either. It's through reflection that we're able to refine our personal values, our sources of meaning, so that when we approach moral dilemmas we're able to maximise the time we live by our values, reflect to refine our values and minimise regret by avoiding attending to things that mean that I.

When you doom scrolls on facebook and instagram, when you decide to impress new friends at the expense of your close friends. When you're making choices that are 

But why does this happen? i'll get into this later


Designing Time well spent

If we want to reduce the time you 

Regretful decisions


If we can create infinitely many rational lines of logic

If we can construct and logic to justify our choices in any two comparable choices what should we let guide our attention in those moments? 

What should should your apply your attention to in those moments?

What could you remember could you remember to make sure that you don't make regretful decisions? 

What might you come back to to ensure that this choice is meaningful

# Andrew's Version 

Expressive Pedagogy - A theory of moral development where as an agent relates to their environment they have to make choices between different social games that they'll participate in and move between. - Based off of work by Ruth Chang on hard choices. Many people are trying to impose scientific comparisons into moral choices. Where a scientific comparison can only be three outcomes: =, <, >. This isn't how moral choices work. In reality, when you have options (for example: yoga class vs. music lesson vs gymnastics) you can construct infinitely many lines of reasoning to justify your choice. This begs the question: what do you let guide your attention in these moments of choice. I would say it's your values. What is a value: In this case, a value is an attentional policy -- something which an agent can remind themselves of or bring to bear on the choice, which helps them to focus their attention on what they find meaningful. Where attending to those things would reduce the regret in a choice and increase time well spent, which is defined as the percentage of time spent living by your values vs. living in regretful choices. Expressive pedagogy tries to maximize time well spent for children and adolescents by helping them to understand their values as they navigate the sea of choices and overtime develop their moral and behavioral character. A current blocker in this is the limited number of social games a child can participate in at a school. They neither have agency to elect on their values, nor bring them to bear on the limited number of social games at a school. It's often only in extracurricular activities or social games outside of school that children discover anything of moral value to them, because unfortunately many of them internalize the norms of school, and carry these with them forever more into the future and into the workplace. They never individuate from these norms. To remedy this, exposing children to an intentional array of social games and giving them an ample time to reflect on their values as they explore those social games would help children develop morally and increase their time well spent. Why Expressive Pedagogy? - The device should help someone discover their values (a meta-value [or virtue?] of reflection). Authentic Choice: - It's easy to mistake someone's choices and self-proclaimed values as values, but they're often polluted with internalized norms (things like professionalism, punctuality, obedience). - We have practices to decouple authentic values from internalized social norms, see: On My Own Terms, Transition Stories, Meaningless Time Journaling, Guessing Game, Emotions to Values, Field Tripping


### Medium Slice 

### What is Expressive Pedagogy?

As with any moral theory I’m going to need to first explicate some terms to construct and explicate something that is inherently wiggly. 

Expressive pedagogy is a theory of character development based on the work of Joe Edelman’s theory of Values and Choice, Ruth Chang’s work on Hard choices, and others in their lineage such as John Taylor and Amarytra Sen. 

It’s a theory and practice in which education system designers and pedagoges try to maximize a person or population’s ‘Time well spent’. 

**Time well spent:** A ratio metric of the time spent living by your values vs. living in regretful choices. 

In practice this means helping people to articulate their values, clarify if they’re actually authentic values by reflecting on their internalised norms, while exploring diverse ‘social games’. Okay new word there. 

**Social games:** is a geeky sociologist frame for thinking about formal or informal activities, interactions, or situations in which individuals engage with others to achieve certain goals or objectives. From this perspective you’re always in some form of social game. Math class, dinner with friends, date night, negotiation, basketball, choir practice and all gradients between are social games. They involve various explicate and implicate roles, rules, expectations, and social norms that participants must navigate.

When approaching a choice between social games (yoga classes vs frisbee in the park) or products ( vegan shampoo vs video games) people remember their values to guide them towards what’s meaningful. By increasing time well spent we increase meaning in people’s lives and develop authentic choices and therefore authentic characters. But only if those choices aren’t clouded by internalised norms or expectations.
