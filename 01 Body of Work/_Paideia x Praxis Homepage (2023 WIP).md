I want to play an infinite game,

The infinite game of knowledge creation.

There is no end so let's quit competing and enjoy the process together.

# My current work.

My team an I are exploring a big question...

>How can our built and information environments (the sea of data we swim in everyday - the internet) become games that help you understand yourself, how the world works and build competencies that help you positively contribute to society?

To answer this question and have the impact I'm looking to have in society I'm networking 100 positive sum friends together that live within a 10 min walking distance from each other for decades at a time.


# Insights of Previous work

I hope to leave this body of work public so that others can walk through my thinking, replicate, debate, critique what i'm doing, so that we can keep  creating new knowledge together.

I never actually intended to work in 'education'. I initially set out to answer these simple questions. 

What is a human?
What supports it's flourishing?
How should I raise my children? 

Here's the TL;DR so far

**What is a human**
A human is not the aggregate or individuals of 
Thoughts
Memory
Emotions
Associations
Perceptions
Actions 
Attention
Intentions 

It's experiences itself as [[disassociated from 'cosmic mind, likely through metabolism]]. 

This biological process sets up the conditions for a [[agent arena relationship]]

The Inquiry process
- Who's in control? conscious vs subconscious
- [[7 fold reasoning ]]
- [[Parts and whole - gestalt and feature list]]
- [[Am I the spirit?]] - Josha Bach Definition 
- [[Many selves IFS, mythology many competing agents]]
- [[The quantified self, IEEE Standards for humans and metrics.]]
- [[Digital Twins]]
- [[Different but the same as my child photos]]
	- Something that is outside of time.
- [[I am not the body, Time and space are not fundamental.]]
- Not my thoughts - Surely I'm my genes? 
- Am I fungible? Quantum entanglement 
- So I'm everything everywhere all at once!
- Process view of the human - Whitehead / Russel 
- I cannot find a human, or a self,
- The closes thing I could say that a human is a wave on an ocean, a pattern perhaps. 
- Strong conviction, strong dukkha
- - [[The best place to hide infinite potential is in a finite being]]
- The take away for designers. Depending on how you construct your view of what a human is will inform your design.

I believe children are born who, perfect, pure. The trajectories of their lives are drawn perfectly by a bowsting made of starts, destined to return to wholeness and love. However due to the pain, shame and conditioning our world impedes their ability to fly true and return to that wholeness.

My life is a project in umasking who I think I am, who my parents, society, school and media told me I am, so I can fly true,\. If I can do this better than parents did before me then I'll be leveling up my ability to do the same for my children. I want this so that they can live a life in deep remembrance of their wholeness. 

Children have superpowers but our social design crushes them out of them. Children are the key to the shackles created by the shortcomings of older generations. Without sustainable futures for them, there is no innovation or progress, no walking through the scientific orchard, or discovery of religious and mystical experience. They are the portal between this world and the future. So opening their creative aperture to manifest, is opening our collective imagination towards new worlds and new ways of being together.
