Hello wonderful human! Serj here. I'm just a future parent who's passionate about creating tools and environments for my child/children's flourishing. But before they enter the world I hope the things I create will be useful to other kids, teens, adults and all our 'inner child'.

I'm currently Founder and CEO of [City as a School (CAS)](https://cityasaschool.com/)

My background is in UX/UI design & Human Computer interaction design for audio interfaces. My life course shifted after coming into the field of learning sciences as an associate at [Wild Learning Sciences CIC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wildlearning/) after a brief encounter with [[Ruth Crick]] at a Hackathon to solve a housing crisis in Bristol, UK, 7 years ago.

Since then I've extended that skillset to

- Corporate and k-12 learning experience design,
- Product Management at [Gaileo](https://galileoxp.com/) Now [Kurbiro](https://kubrio.com/?ref=galileoxp.com)
- General Manager of a Coliving space in Bali for Blockchain, Sustainability entrepreneurs and artists called [The Nyx](https://www.thenyxbali.com/)
- Ongoing independent research focused on learner [[agency]], self directed learning [[Learning power]] and [[06 Notes/Expressive Pedagogy]]
- Facilitating design sprints for progressive public schools in the U.S. and Universities in the U.K. 
- Content Design for [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- Learning experience designer / guide / activist in the humane tech movement as part of the founding team and curriculum designer at [Human Systems](https://human-systems.org/), (Now the ['School for Social Design'](http://sdfs.com/) 
- and now apply the [Human Systems Methodology](https://www.notion.so/humsys/Values-Based-Social-Design-6397f7852775434982e363924d7e07e7) to my organisation City as a School.
- I've lead workshops for ed-tech / future of work founders via [Transcend Network](https://transcend-network.com/) fellowship.
- I previously run a 'Tools for Thought' and Pedagogy lab at [Paideia X Praxis](https://paideiaxpraxis.com/) which taught people how to use Notion and other tools for personal knowledge management
- Hacking on A.I tools for self-directed learning using GPT-3 and other Language models at Vivid (Awaiting Reboot at City as a School)
- Co-designed and Led [Learning sprints](https://www.thelearningsprint.com/)
- I'm also a huge proponent of lightning network & Bitcoin. 

I consult and coach a maximum of three individuals and/or organisations a year that are working on a project with significant potential for creating a more hopeful, humane, inspiring and empowering education ecosystem. 

Where am I going? I believe networks of people with interdependent relationships built on mutual care, are best primed for using new technologies for democratically discussing and voting on what kinds of economies realities they'd like to live in, what facilities and resources should/nt exist.

 Therefore learning communities, networks of home schoolers, and distributed campuses e.t.c are my 'Trojan Horse' for deploying next generational [[participatory / civic technologies]], inspired by the ideas at groups like [@RadxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/) and by continued application of my work at @human systems.

## Research Overview

If you've landed here, chances are, you're probably familiar with some of my work. Behind that work is me carving a path to remain deeply connected to some of my [turtly questions](https://www.notion.so/Turtleocracy-47a6df7692bf4e95a39504a73a50a295) which revolve around a couple main themes.

**🔍 Why Ed-Tech has failed to disrupt the classroom and alternate approaches to designing & deploying.**

**🔍  Adaptive & high [[agency]] learners and development of character identity** 

**🔍 Cross-cultural anthropological studies on human development, learning networks and communities of practice.**

**🔍 Intergenerational & Inter-Org Knowledge Transfer - What can we learn from the longest enduring organizations? What and whose knowledge should be preserved and passed on to future generations / How and why will it be taught?**

**🔍 Scenius, Matchmaking and CrowdSource Problem Solving - What teaching, learning and relating is best to foster scenius? What technologies will help us solve problems together?**


Generally I'm interested in designing trusted learning outside of changing how schools operate or single programmes.

I love questions of what new conditions or environments are required for people to engage and practice new behaviours, explore meaning-making and develop character outside of becoming useful to a labor market. 

I've often found the conversation around what the best school might be, to be an un-fruitful line of inquiry. That's because I believe many of the issues we face in education are downstream of larger global systems such as healthcare, economics and military systems.

Education systems are emergent from informal social practices. The gig economy, universal basic Income, longer life expectancy through medical sciences, and rising teacher workloads, all enable and constrain the quality and shape of this thing we call the future of learning. 

Instead, I'm interested in what kinds of social and technological environments, economies and cultures are required to support the development and diversity of a learner's complex life world, curiosities, values, inspirations and intelligences?

As I alternate between 'researcher mode' to 'implementer mind' I'll be creating experiments for social and silicon technologies that support life long learning, and communities of practice.

My experiments are often [action research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_research) meaning that I answer questions mainly through building, running workshops and creating learning experiences while reflecting in the process.

Underlying all this is a belief; That children are the key to the shackles created by the shortcomings of older generations. Without sustainable futures for them, there is no innovation or progress, no walking through the scientific orchard, or discovery of religious and mystical experience. They are the portal between this world and the future. So opening their creative aperture is opening our collective imagination towards new worlds and new ways of being together.

Ultimately I hope, with your support, we can create novel small scale learning-protopias. Learning spaces where the norms and interactions around pedagogy, curriculum, technology and assessments are quite different.

Your support for this journey is deeply appreciated. With nervous excitement and wild curiosity.
