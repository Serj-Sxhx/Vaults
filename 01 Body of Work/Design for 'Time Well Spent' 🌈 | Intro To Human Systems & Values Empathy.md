# Design for 'Time Well Spent' 🌈 | Intro To Human Systems & Values Empathy

Many designers understnad goals and emotional empathy. We design for them in our apps and communities. We believe that building values empathy, an understanding of how a user wants to treat people, show up, act, approach life, is essential for making tech feel less shitty. It is the collapse of meaning in doom scrolling, flame wars and being forced into funnel, that prevents us from 'time well spent'. If we can design for this as interface, environment and organisation designers then we'll have a much happier, wholesome world.
