OUR STUDENTS ARE TEACHERS, ALL TEACHERS ARE STUDENTS, EVERYONE IS A CREATOR

---

It's pretty undisputed that learning to learn and being a critical self-directed lifelong learner is one of the best competencies to develop in our fast paced, ever changing world. Indeed in uncertain times the only truly important skill is to learn, unlearn and adapt.

"Over the next century, scholars and fans aided by computational algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We'll come to understand that no work, no idea, stands truly alone, but that all good true and beautiful things are networks, ecosystems of intertwined parts, related entities and similar works" - **Kevin Kelly - Editor Wired Magazine**

[[Zachery Stein]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Marshal Machluen]] and many other pioneers in educational theory all point to a converging new form of learning configuration. The ecosystem. 

My goal in this note is to synthesize they ideas presented to outline a schema of the proposed system, it's mechanisms, assumptions and finally experiments by which we can reduce risk and uncertainty in the project.

# Introduction
What are the barriers and enablers faced by attempts to create or catalyse learning ecosystems?

Promoting learning ecosystems as a supplementary and necessary paradigm and pattern for learning to prepare people for a world of rapidly increasing complexity


# Why now

In the face of greater complexity and 

-  As many as 60% of young people today in Australia are studying or training for occupations that could be automated in the next decade ([Foundation of Young Australians: The New Work Order, 2015](https://www.fya.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/new-work-order-2015.pdf)).

Across the globe there is a growing consensus that education demands radical transformation if we want all citizens to become future-ready in the face of a world that's becoming increasingly more complex. Education has the potential to be the greatest enabler of preparing everyone, young and old, for the future, yet supporting learning too often remains an issue for schools alone.

Talk is a exploration of thinking outside of how individual programs or schools operate.

Exhaustion of the existing educational paradigm Most education systems are struggling to keep pace with the rapid changes in society, the workplace and across the world. They are failing to tackle some of the key issues (Perkins, 2014) of our time, and at worst, are contributing to them. 

The growing gap between the education systems we have, and what the future needs from education (Facer, 2011; Clayton, et al, 2008) is the burning platform that has sparked a call for a paradigm shift (Robinson, 2010), which learning ecosystems may begin to offer. 

In many systems (not all), top-down reforms have created a number of perversities, often leading to: • Unprecedented anxieties and stress levels of students widely attributed to high-stakes assessment (OECD, 2015); • Disillusioned and burnt-out teachers facing a loss of professional identity linked to high accountability regimes (National Education Union, 2018) • A tendency of schools and practitioners to avoid risk-taking and therefore quashing the potential for emergent innovative practice (Cisco, 2010).




around the world, and build a wide range of possible new relationships among business, education, government, and community

What happens when young people engage with a range of resources within a broader community, charged with the power of social interaction in the connected-world.

What kinds of learning systems can sense an environment effectively, adapt and reconfigure itself to both the needs of a labour market and an individuals's sense of identity and purpose?

The timing of this moment is fortunate as we (humanity as a whole) are currently beset by a pantheon of “wicked problems.” Problems like ecosystem collapse, the accelerating breakdown of social and political coherence, and the event horizon of exponential technology. These are “wicked” both because they represent world-historical risk (i.e., they are very important) and because they are strictly insoluble using our current “problem solving” toolkit

# Ecosystems in Theory vs practice

[The Learning Society - Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/citizenship/socio-economic/docs/LearningSociety_WhitePaper.pdf)

 a biological metaphor in response to complexity.

 biological ecosystems seem a perfect fit for the change requirements in education 
 
they are metaphorically attractive as a way of thinking about the future because Ecosystems both provide and require:

capture the advantages of centralization and coordination produced by hierarchy while attempting to harness the advantages of more decentralized organizational structures.

 ### Diversity: 
 
 Multiple providers that fulfil many roles, allowing for “structural stability” of the ecosystem

 ### Maximum productivity and resource cycling within the ecosystem:
 
 Resources including knowledge, are optimized and distributed so nothing goes to waste.

 ### Dynamic adaptability: 
 
 Ecosystems can adapt and respond to learner needs and changes of institutional environments (this is the critical feature that distinguishes ecosystems from earlier, and more rigid, approaches of ‘partnership’).

 ### Scalability: 
 
 Ecosystems can operate on various scales, from learner groups or specific schools to the planetary 

  It is worth noting that the application of the ecosystem metaphor to fields of human endeavour has a long history in disciplines other than education and learning. Ecosystem as both an analytical tool and a practical strategy has been explored in business and management theory for at least two decades (Moore, 1996) and complexity economics (Beinhocker, 2007) has been gaining ground for around the same period. In each case, the introduction of the ecosystem metaphor has been a response to the limitations of simple market equilibrium models or hierarchies for understanding and shaping systems

  
 Let's explore whether the opportunity exists to create dynamic, diverse and evolving learning ecosystems which enable all young people to be lifelong learners, leveraging a broader and more powerful range of assets than ever before. Such a reconfiguration of education systems and our collective mindset promise to create the conditions for more dynamic and powerful collaborations which stimulate and enable innovation.


Thinking ‘system’ (not just isolated innovations) is clearly imperative; but the concept of ‘system’ needs to be rethought too. If the promise of local learning ecosystems is to be realized, then system leaders at jurisdiction levels will need to reposition themselves so that rather than being primarily providers of education, they intentionally create a platform for a diversity of players, and offer vision, stewardship and enablement to this (Global Education Leaders’ Partnership, 2013).

The term ‘system’ can have negative connotations because of its association with top-down reforms, which have limitations even in successful systems. In this vision, ecosystems can enable collaboration and innovation without bureaucratic and/or market control: they may become horizontal, or bottom-up.

Municipalities (education providers) are given free reign to do whatever they like. Teachers are seen as experts


### Innovation ecosystems and learning ecosystems 

> “Where you have the diversity of players required for an innovation ecosstem you will also have the conditions for a learning ecosystem” Rosie Clayton - 

# What is a learning ecosystem

Deriving from the field of evolutionary biology, an ‘ecosystem’ is a community of interdependent organisms acting in conjunction with the natural environment.

There are obviously already ecosystems which are networks of schools alone, or involve partnerships between schools, community and industry by are controlled wholly by the school  but our focus is on ecosystems that have a few common features 

• Are diversifying learning resources and pathways for learners 
• Are activating and sharing resources for learning in new ways from diverse sources 
• Are dynamic in composition and porous around the edges 
• Are supported by helpful infrastructure 
• Comprise formal and informal learning institutions, traditional and new entrants 
• Have distributed governance 
• Are learner driven or have learner [[agency]] at their heart 
• Make an attempt to meet twenty first century challenges in some way, beyond academic attainment.

### Benefits 

strong emphasis on shifting intrinsic human values, Ashoka and others envision learning ecosystems to be suited to educating and empowering the whole human. Through empathy-based learning and an emphasis on human relationships and collective action, learning ecosystems can help shift human identity away from individualistic self-interest, towards one centred on humanistic change-making (Wagner & Compton, 2012).


### 3 Types of Ecosystem - A Topology 
not mutually exclusive.

#### Knowledge sharing ecosystems 

operating at global or national level

This type of ecosystem comprises complex, evolving networks of organizations including think tanks, foundations, governmental and global agencies and others who are consciously connecting to facilitate the sharing of new knowledge about education and learning, innovation, funding opportunities, and more. It is largely concerned with building the global shared knowledge base, scaling innovation and enabling the better use of resources and opportunities to tackle shared global learning challenges, not only within but between networks.

#### Innovation Ecosystems 

operating at city or jurisdictional level

Some cities and regions are involved in designing deliberate conditions that drive and accelerate radical innovation - such as new designs for schooling - through the combination of multiple players, policies and platforms. These innovation ecosystems tend to contain traditional and new education providers, formal and informal learning opportunities, the involvement of business, edtech developers and providers and higher education, and are supported by digital technology.

#### Learning ecosystems

operating at city or local level

Learning ecosystems comprise diverse combinations of providers (schools, businesses, community organizations as well as government agencies) creating new learning opportunities and pathways to success. They are usually supported by an innovative credentialing system or technology platforms that replace or augment the traditional linear system of examinations and graduation. They need not, however, be confined to their geographic location in terms of resources overall. They may exploit the technologies now available to choreograph global learning resources, if they do that then they can be thought of as 'global'

This will be the focus for my presentation today.

Features 

Learning ecosystems are a possible, though not guaranteed, product of an innovation ecosystem.

learning ecosystems focus exclusively on delivering powerful, often radically diverse, learning experiences for young people

# Case Studies

## 1. RSA Cities of Learning, UK

 a mix of national and city based funding for Cities of Learning – bringing together corporate partners, grant funders, and public sector funders

Activating a grassroots, city- based, mass engagement movement around lifelong learning and skills.


### The ecosystem at a glance

_What is the learning ecosystem?_

Cities of Learning (CofL) is a new place based approach to enhancing lifelong learning through digitally connecting individuals to learning, employment and civic opportunities within a defined locality. 

It brings together learning, work and civic institutions (schools, colleges, employers, training providers, charities, local authorities, libraries, museums, coding clubs, makerspaces and so on) to form purposeful city- wide networks.

The approach is orientated around three key design principles: 

new civic leadership, 
mobilizing diverse networks of learning providers,
connecting different learning opportunities via a digital platform. 

the two pilots is between 14 to 25 years old,

_When was it established? _

In 2015, the RSA’s report ‘The New Digital Learning Age’ advised that the UK should explore piloting a City of Learning, building on the original work of Collective Shift in the United States and other global initiatives such as UNESCO Learning Cities.

In 2017 the RSA and Digitalme collaborated with Greater Manchester, Brighton and Plymouth to test and prototype the Cities of Learning approach, with pilots expected in early 2019. 

_To what extent has it scaled? _

The RSA and Digitalme are currently working towards formal piloting with two UK Cities, Plymouth and Brighton. External evaluations from these pilots will be available from Summer 2020. A parallel pipeline of conversations are underway with other UK and international cities and localities keen to develop and prototype the CofL model. 

In addition, exploratory conversations are taking place with employers and businesses, Multi Academy Trusts, and other strategic bodies such as Local Enterprise Partnerships, Arts Council, Public Health bodies, and Housing Associations interested in the application of the concept in their own context.

_Funding model _

Currently, there is a mix of national and city based funding for Cities of Learning – bringing together corporate partners, grant funders, and public sector funders to achieve greater impact together. Long term, the financial model is expected to shift over time from a model which is on the whole supported through national funding, to a predominantly city-based model with diverse funding streams.

_Badge-based pathways_

CofL does not intend to replace formal assessments. Rather it seeks to integrate digital badges and place-based programs into a wider movement that can drive increased engagement, promote more equal access to opportunity and social capital, and cultivate a culture of learning. T



_Equitable pathways for all citizens, regardless of background_

### Eduació360,  or ‘full-time learning'

https://www.educacio360.cat/

Against a background of debates about the length of the school day and in the inequality of families’ ability to pay for after school activities, the Educaió360 Alliance seeks to enshrine the right of all young people to a coherent and high quality out-of-school learning offer, backed by state-wide policy and operationalized by municipalities.

The ecosystem at a glance 

_What is the learning ecosystem?_

An alliance of municipalities and partners committed to making high quality out-of-school learning opportunities available to all children and young people in Catalonia. 

34 local authorities have signed the manifesto and joined the network, of which 11 are actively piloting approaches to how they can make the offer a reality in their locality.

_When was it established? _

The Alliance has been established for two years although some of the pilots pre-date the establishment of the Educació360 network. 

_To what extent has it scaled?_ 

52 local authorities and 48 other partners from across Catalonia have signed up, and 11 localities are actively engaged in pilot programmes.


_Examples of piolet programs_

Uses alternative learning spaces in cultural facilities through workshops with professionals and experts from various institutions.

Key features • An Educació360 Manifesto that sets a common goal for municipalities and other partners. • Policy and political advocacy to enshrine the entitlement to high quality out-of-school learning for all children. • Network events, workshops and training to enable learning between pilots. • No blueprint for pilot sites; each municipality works towards the goal in ways that suit their context. • Annual Educació360 week, digital badge support, Children’s Passport provided and promoted at network level.

While the manifesto makes reference to integrating in-school and out-of-school learning, the focus is very much on mobilising and organising community and municipality funded assets: seeking to change the context within with young people and schools operate, rather than starting with schools themselves.

> “Some people talk about replacing school. We don’t feel this is feasible or even desirable. We feel school has real value for universal education for all children and other values such as social cohesion... we still feel that school is a good model but has to change dramatically how it works and its role.” - Monica Nadal, Jaume Bofill Foundation

Thus, in a parallel initiative, Escola 21, the Bofill Foundation is supporting efforts to ‘transform the DNA of schools’ to fundamentally change how schools operate. But the Foundation also recognise that the context in which schools operate needs to change too.

The alliance promotes some common ‘key drivers’ that enable learning, sharing and a common language between localities including digital badges, Educació360 week, and a Children’s Passport.

Key learnings

The focus on the role of municipal authorities also makes clear that ultimately the governance and funding of the learning ecosystems would be held by state authorities if the campaign is successful. This of course comes with all of the opportunities for universalism and democratic oversight, and some of the potential downside of potentially bureaucratic processes

the alliance is being built from the bottom up by engaging new players and creating a sense of a movement among partners

3. LRNG, various cities, USA 2015 https://www.home.lrng.org/

What is the learning ecosystem? LRNG works with city networks and organizations to connect out-ofschool learning experiences to career opportunities through facilitating direct relationships supported by a digital platform and ‘playlists’ of digital badges. It aims to ensure that all young people, especially those from underserved communities, have inspiration and guidance to prepare them for life and work in the modern economy.

experts who are not professional educators; they make their expertise available to learners in a direct unmediated way. This is radical: it makes live the notion that education is, or should be, everybody’s business


This is the most learner-driven of our case studies: both in terms of the design of overall offer, and of the learner pathways, which are chosen by learners and not fixed or pre-determined.

a tech platform is center stage but still requires local organizations who can relate this work to their own agenda. With a focus on tech there is less of an imperative to design innovative governance arrangements. 

Funding is coming from philanthropic sector.

Small organizations can apply for up to $5,000 (USD) to create design challenges playlists, receive technical assistance and create badges. Many youth workers want to see their young people flourish and will encourage those they work with to take part and get involved with the platform.

4. Kuopio Culture Path, Kuopio, Finland 

In the others we've seen impact such as 

The Cultural Paths serve 10,000 students in grades 1 to 9. During 2017 the Kuopio Museum received 35,067 visitors out of about 118,000 city inhabitants; 23,936 of them were free visitors, mostly school children and others under 18 years old. 9,314 of them participated in a guided tour.

6. Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia 

The ecosystem at a glance What is the learning ecosystem? Swinburne University of Technology work with industry and community partners (such as Siemens and the Australian Synchrotron), primary and secondary schools, and the Australian government to provide enriching STEM learning programs as part of a pilot ecosystem designed to raise awareness of STEM disciplines. To better support lifelong learning, Swinburne are investing heavily in building a dynamic, interactive, career management platform to connect groups across the ecosystem and allow users to meaningfully develop their own unique ‘professional purpose’, informed by real-time market data.

400 schools engaged in STEM school engagement programs 38,790 school students engaged in STEM school engagement programs 116 Swinburne students engaged in STEM school engagement programs

7. The Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Centre ‘The Met’, Providence, Rhode Island, USA

Since 1996, The Met has developed a sophisticated practice for working together with its community in Providence, Rhode Island, to reimagine and reshape education

The Met provides real world, interest-led learning pathways by engaging mentors from the community, mobilizing local businesses and building partnerships with further and higher education institutions. It operates a personalized learning design that allows each learner to pursue their passions and interests, in line with an individual learning plan negotiated between teacher, parent or carer, and learner.

The Met School is only a small high school of 875 students, the Big Picture Learning design it established has scaled to over 65 Big Picture network schools in the United States and over a hundred around the world. Schools in Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, India, Kenya, Barbados, Belize, and New Zealand utilise the BPL design.]

*Key Insights *

The Met School reaches meaningfully into the community by enrolling families and community mentors in supporting the learning of each individual learner.

Built their own school which embodies these ways of learning from the very get go so they didn't need to change the DNA of existing schools like other examples. 

Despite challenging the ideas of what ‘schooling’ should be the Met is highly successful on conventional metrics, with very high proportions of its graduates entering or graduating from college.


8. LenPolyGrafMash, St Petersburg, Russia 

LenPolyGrafMash (LPM) is a co-working business space for those interested in technological entrepreneurs and education. Owners of the space are attempting to significantly transform the working culture of both the space and St Petersburg, and create a learning offer that connects with the skills needs of the businesses on the site

An intermediary role is required to connect organizations and institutions who are used to working in silos.

“weavers” working group has been established as a partnership consisting of twelve institutions, including the national agency for innovation development, three universities, and several private companies such as RosNano School League and National University 2035.

Mindsets need to shift before new skills and ways of working can be developed. There currently isn’t enough demand in Russia at the moment.


10. Remake Learning, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA Founded 2007

A collective of individuals and organizations in Western Pennsylvania are working alongside public school systems to ignite engaging, relevant, and equitable learning practices. This local learning ecosystem, anchored in the city of Pittsburgh, supports learners of school age to gain learning experiences that respond to technological and societal change in a post-industrial city in the rust belt of the United States.

The Remake Learning network consists of more than 500 organizations in the region, with 137 school districts, as well as museums, libraries, other out-of-school education non-profits, philanthropies, government bodies, industry partners large and small, and startups in the education space. It has trained over 5,300 educators (formal and non-formal) in innovative teaching methods, and has granted $70 million (USD) philanthropic support to local learning innovation.

# The Challenges that Ecosystems 

What are the barriers and enablers faced by attempts to create or catalyse learning ecosystems?

Do real-world learning ecosystems really represent a new learning paradigm, as described in the literature?

#### 1. The exhaustion of the existing educational paradigm, on its own terms; 

Exhaustion of the existing educational paradigm Most education systems are struggling to keep pace with the rapid changes in society, the workplace and across the world. They are failing to tackle some of the key issues (Perkins, 2014) of our time, and at worst, are contributing to them. The growing gap between the education systems we have, and what the future needs from education (Facer, 2011; Clayton, et al, 2008) is the burning platform that has sparked a call for a paradigm shift (Robinson, 2010), which learning ecosystems may begin to offer. In many systems (not all), top-down reforms have created a number of perversities, often leading to: • Unprecedented anxieties and stress levels of students widely attributed to high-stakes assessment (OECD, 2015); • Disillusioned and burnt-out teachers facing a loss of professional identity linked to high accountability regimes (National Education Union, 2018) • A tendency of schools and practitioners to avoid risk-taking and therefore quashing the potential for emergent innovative practice (Cisco, 2010).


#### 2. The need for a shift in purpose in the context of rapid, fundamental change 

Shift in purpose Writers who have taken a holistic view of a wide and profound set of purposes for education often see ecosystems as part of the solution for delivering these (Hannon & Peterson, 2017; Fadel, et al, 2015). For instance, GEF locates the need for learning ecosystems in a world view of a fundamentally transformed human project, one that includes, but isn’t limited to an entirely altered set of values and relationships to the planet. They see learning ecosystems as capable of compensating for broader failures of public policies, and acting as a pathway to social transformation. 

> “Education can become an avenue through which global society may overcome the gaps and barriers we have created: the digital divide, the imbalance of information flows, the growing economic and social inequality, religious, ethical, and cultural divides, and extreme ecological pressures we are placing on Earth.” Global Education Futures report, 2018



#### 3. The need for a new organizational paradigm to deliver this shift.

Other questions arise around the extent to which learning ecosystems emerge naturally in response to conditions of twenty-first century connectivity, or whether they require intentional design. It seems that this apparent tension between ‘tight’ design and control on the one hand, and desire for ‘loose’ distributed, organic and dynamic processes on the other, might be central to our understanding of the success of learning ecosystems to deliver on outcomes and the role they might play in challenging or replacing the existing paradigm of organised learning.

In the traditional  system where education is primarily the business of schools and other formal education institutions Policy in this scenario is a key lever. with which governments set agendas requiring education institutions, along with support agencies, to respond with a specified change, or limited range of changes, to practice on the ground. Complexity now makes it impossible for these traditional organizational structures and policy levers to navigate.

need to shift mindsets towards thinking in the interests of the entire ecosystem, rather than the interests of our individual self, or single groups of stakeholders (Scharmer et al 2013; Senge 2006)

This raises the question of the role of identity, purpose and community in education systems.

New ways of collective learning and acting within and across teams, organisations, and communities are emerging as part of an alternative discipline to the top-down mechanisms of the past, outlining a new path towards systemic change.

### How can we think differently

To better understand the barriers and enablers to learning ecosystems let's look at the 

governance 
funding arrangements, 
new roles for people and organisations
the role of context and place

 a question to be explored in the future, as local learning ecosystems develop and mature, will be: how resilient are they to the removal of initial catalytic funding, the entry of dysfunctional members or other unanticipated shifts in the environment?

 redefine the concept of education as a cradle to grave process of learning and development where the process of learning is not separated from the process of living. 

# Frameworks for 

### 1- Stages of learning ecosystem 

We can think of learning ecosystems being shaped by four stages through which 
they  develop and grow: 

hypothesis and visioning, 
catalysing and initiating, 
dynamic experimentation, and 
mainstreaming or sustaining. 

 At each stage there are questions and dilemmas that an ecosystem might meet
 

### 2- Impact of learning ecosystems on existing learning provision

a movement towards learning ecosystems has the potential to transform how learning happens.

 Across all the cases you can think of the impact that an ecosystem willl have on existing provisions on two axes. In doing so, four broad categories of learning ecosystems have been discerned:
 
 1. Expanded formal offers designed with pre-determined curricula and/or outcomes; 
 2. Industry or community led initiatives where the skills requirements of a group from outside education (e.g. an industry sector) leads them to put in place conditions to enable new learning pathways and opportunities that meet the industry’s need; 
 3. New designs and new platforms where a high degree of learner agency meets intentional design and results in new wholesale designs for organised learning. 4
 4. Responsively dynamic where learner agency meets a dynamic and self-sustaining community of providers eager to support and enhance learning.
