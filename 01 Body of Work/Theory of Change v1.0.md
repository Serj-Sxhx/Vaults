**If** we engage, upskill, and give technology that helps teens to make sense of social challenges **then** they will join and create movements taking civic action **so that** youth can lead the movement to create a more positive and sustainable future.

**Goal**: To equip young people with the skills, support, and technology needed to make sense of and solve local and global social and environmental challenges.

**Assumptions**: Young people need access to high-quality learning content, supportive mentors, and technology to tackle complex social and environmental issues.

Traditional education systems often fail to provide young people with the skills and support needed to address social and environmental challenges.

Providing young people with self-directed learning experiences, supportive mentors, and A.I technology can help them understand complex domains and develop the skills and confidence needed to solve social and environmental problems.

**Activities**:

Provide a self-directed learning experience through the web app and learning centres.

Build learning relationships around a learner from our network of supportive mentors for each challenge area.

Provide technology resources to young people to support their problem-solving.

Offer opportunities for young people to apply their skills to local and global challenges.

Provide a portfolio app to help young people track their progress and experiences.

**Outputs:**

A network of young people, mentors, and teachers engaged with City as a School.

Young people who are equipped with skills, confidence, and technology to tackle social and environmental challenges.

A portfolio app that helps young people demonstrate and evidence their learning while building social capital.

**Outcomes**:

Young people gain the skills and confidence needed to tackle social and environmental challenges.

Young people have access to a supportive community of mentors and peers.

Traditional education systems are disrupted by a viable alternative system that demonstrates success in preparing young people to tackle complex social and environmental challenges.

Society benefits from the innovative and impactful contributions of young people.
