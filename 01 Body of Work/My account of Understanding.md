Understanding is a complex cognitive process that allows individuals to comprehend, analyze, and apply information in diverse situations. 

This essay presents my account of Understanding, which comprises of three aspects of understanding which constrain and afford each-other: Interpretation, Inference, and Convergence. By examining each aspect, we aim to offer educators a framwork for thinking about strategies to support a learner to deepen their understanding of any topic.

My fear after speaking to many secondary public and private school teachers who’s performance, guarantee of income and feeding their families is measured by their ability to get as many students high grades on standardised tests, is this: A large percentage of our teachers cant’s give me a clear account of what it means to understand something and substitute cultivating it for delivering on exams results. Without a clear account of what understanding is and how to increase or deepen it, it will be hard to know how to support a learner’s development and thus lead our society astray with misguided citizens who don’t know how to know. 

### Aspect 1 - Interpretation: Basic Understanding

Interpretation involves building and using mental models to bring order to seemingly chaotic information. At this level, a learner can identify patterns, structures, and relationships within a specific context. 

Building mental models is not a linear process. Even when someone has achieved deep understanding of a topic, they might return to the intial mental models they created and modify or update them based on insights from aspects 2 and 3. Aspect 1 is iterative in nature. 

Refining mental models over time is a constant process x 

Example: In a game of chess, a beginner may see a chaotic arrangement of pieces on the board, while an experienced player can discern patterns and strategies at play.

To hi-light the iterative nature of Aspect 1:

Example: In learning a new language, a student might initially struggle to comprehend grammar rules and vocabulary. As they revisit these concepts over time, their understanding gradually deepens, highlighting the iterative nature of the Interpretation aspect.  

### Aspect 2 - Inference: Intermediate Understanding

Inference is the ability to relate mental models from one context to another using analogy, comparison, and contrast. A learner at this stage can identify similarities, differences, and shared deep structures between models in different contexts and draw meaningful implications from those comparisons. 

This stage may be influenced by emotions, motivation, and cultural factors that shape understanding, sometimes leading to biased or constrained interpretations.  

Example: A musician trained in classical music might be able to recognize similarities and differences in composition and structure when listening to jazz or other genres, allowing them to make connections and appreciate new styles of music.

To hi-light the point on emotions, motivation and cultural factors shaping understanding. 

Example: A historian studying the political climate of two different eras may unconsciously allow their personal biases, emotions, or cultural background to influence their comparison, resulting in a less objective analysis.  

### Aspect 3 - Convergence: Deep Understanding

Convergence is the capacity to validate, support, and strengthen mental models using multiple lines of reasoning. A learner at this stage can apply their models across various contexts and build convergence, ultimately increasing their conviction in the accuracy and explanatory power of their understanding. 

Nonetheless, the framework may oversimplify the complexities of understanding in specific domains, which could limit the applicability of the Convergence stage in those areas.  

Example: A philosopher attempting to reach a deep understanding of an abstract concept might need to rely more on critical thinking, introspection, and dialogue than simply seeking converging evidence, as the Convergence stage suggests.


### Conclusion:  

The revised Three-Tiered Framework of Understanding acknowledges and integrates the assumptions and limitations previously outlined, providing a more comprehensive perspective on the cognitive process of understanding. By breaking down understanding into Interpretation, Inference, and Convergence, and considering the effects of linearity, emotions, motivation, cultural factors, and domain-specific complexities, learners can better grasp how to develop their skills and knowledge in various domains. This updated framework serves as a valuable tool for university students to enhance their understanding and learning in diverse contexts, while recognizing the complexities that shape their cognitive processes

I wonder if all aspects are influenced by emotions, motivation, and cultural factors. These might shape understanding, sometimes leading to biased or constrained interpretations.
