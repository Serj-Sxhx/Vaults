- The Age of Augmentation
# Becoming Augmented



# Cultural Transmission 

Most traditional fields of human striving feature a pattern of “the student becomes the master.”

- What is an augmentor
- Why do we need them
	- Instructor led 
	- Algorithm led
	- Peer led
	- A combination of peer driven, mentor guided and AI content assisted is the new intersection for ed-tech to focus on. 
	  
	  Moocs - nuff said.
	  Why? - AI adaptive tutors have only been effective in Maths and English. 

## What's different about now?

It seems what's uniquely different about this new wave of AI in education is that it's not about improving recommendation engines that deliver standardised content as an adaptive tutor. 


Instead humans are now directly interfacing with the combined collective intelligence of all of human-kind, AKA the internet.

It's a shift from outside-in to inside-out change in learning. 

This is fundamentally what Augmentors are about. 

- It's a drawing out of the innate knowledge creation capacities of the human mind, and guiding reflection to improve the helping th

## Superhistory not Superintelligence.

I think there's a misconception of current A.I. which Venkatesh Rao provides some clarity in this article. 

"... start thinking about AI in terms of time rather than intelligence. 

Specifically, modern AI is better understood as AT — “Artificial Time” that can be prosthetically attached to human minds.

And highly capable computing systems are best understood as _existing in superhistory_ rather than _embodying superintelligence_"

Since the first search engines we've been learning to live in superhistory.

If the way schools, specifically standardised tests responded to the advent of google was deploying anti cheating software (Name), this new wave of AI will be hilarious to watch.



## Humans are not software 2.0
Our thinking is constrained by human cultural transmission modes.

For exammples. If you're learning anything from this essay, it is not from the same input data that shamped my own understanding. You are learning from my human-scale digested understanding, and writing ability and all my personal limits. 

I have not easy way to just let you pool my input data into yours. You can't think with two-human-lives worth of data.

> A player trained by AIs is obviously going to develop a very different style compared to those who train by playing against the living humans around them. Their minds are not going to be bound by tradition like those of humans taught by other humans. Their development is not going to be constrained by human cultural transmission modes.

> The Carlsen style of latent-centaur learning is going to benefit from what is effectively hundreds of human-equivalent years (HEY) of _digested_ chess-playing experience the AI has acquired during its model-training phase, and is applying in the inference phase in new games. And unlike Young-Carlsen-era AIs, modern AIs aren’t even limited to learning only from past human experience. As AlphaGoZero demonstrated, you can do even better by throwing away accumulated human experience and simply generating new data by having the AI play against itself.

> So a modern player trained in a well-designed learning loop against the latest AIs has a true "player age" that is some function of their biological age, and their inherited "AI age" that is a measure of the human-equivalent experience time latent in the training data

> Magnus Carlsen is really 200 years old. Whoever unseats Magnus Carlsen will be 2000 years old.

> This is _not_ like belonging to an intellectual tradition, with a lineage of masters passing on their knowledge and skills through books and teaching. That process of cultural transmission is limited by the individual-human-mind bottlenecks it must periodically pass through.

> Machine learning is not constrained that way, so long as raw data is cheap enough to store. And if you can access that learning, you too, can be a latent centaur like Magnus Carlsen.

## Digital Twins

I'm hopeful that AI will move towards actually human 'intelligence' as we develop meta-learning models but for now - our definitions of AI are mistaken, narrow yet still have a profound impact on how we'll learn.

"We can digitally capture and preserve vastly more data from any human activity than any human mind involved in it could directly comprehend, process, or transmit. 
This is the threshold that matters - blowing past human cultural transmission bandwidth limits."

This is largely due to the huge drop in cost for data storage. We now have far more data.

(Data over time)

The inhumane part of the current education system is 

- 22 years of teacher bias
- Instilling mindsets and behaviours that don't promote critical thinking
- 

## Risks



This is obviously full of risks. If data and content of the internet is mostly 'trash', then wont the responses be mostly trashy? 

It seems that ChatGPT is great at a few things

# Old Version

In the course of the next 20 years, more will change around the way we learn and do our work than has happened in the last 2,000. 

My bet is that this change will take much longer than the technologists predict. Static institutions and lack of directed political will.

We're at the dawn of a new age in human history.

There have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work, the tech we've harnessed, and the form of our social organisation.

The Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years. And then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years. The Industrial Age lasted a couple of centuries. And now the Information Age has lasted just a few decades. Now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.

The Augmented Age.

In this new era, your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented by computational systems that help you think, robotic systems that help you make, and a digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.

We don't tend to think of ourselves this way, but we're already augmented. Is someone asks you a question now. You can find the answer from your collective 'super history' AKA, the Internet.

Even Siri is just a passive tool.

In fact, for the last three-and-a-half million years, the tools that we've had have been completely passive. They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.

Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.
The chisel only carves where the artist points it.
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.

In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me, we've always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools like, manual, literally using our hands, even with computers.

But that is coming to an end. We want to be able to say to a computer. "Computer, let's design a car," and the computer shows me a car. And I say, "No, more fast-looking, and less German," and bang, the computer shows me an option.

That conversation might be a little ways off, probably less than many of us think, but right now, we're working on it.

Tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative. All it needs are your goals and your constraints.

## What is an Augmentor 

> Augmenting humans with machine learning in the right way raises their effective _experiential_ age. They possess greater "lived experience" than their biological age would suggest because they've acquired prosthetic experience, in digested, summary form.

This new age requires a new age kind of 'educator' 
It used to be the case that humans relied on 

For the lineage traditions, this will still be the case.

For the vast majority of human knowledge, this relationship is 

Super history to human bandwidth is much higher.


As an Augmentor you're pursuit of freedom understanding  to reduce suffering of all beings in all time in all space through the pursuit of understanding.


What is understanding? 
By understanding your 
Interior self, 
Exterior Self 
Interior Collective 
External Collective 

You'll become integrated. 

The world around you is not as it seems. It's moved by

And there's holes in everything that you think is 'real'.
