Alexander through Constantine

What did schools look like at this time as it established scale in Europe.

It's popular and fashionable to be greek, Helen (the greek word for Greece)
There's a love of greek culture and literacy + homer, greek language is awesome, it's still a second language. Building greekness into your soul.

Based around the trivium
- Literacy: Writing and reading in that order, some numeracy
- Grammar: Literary devices, grammar, interpretation
- Rhetoric: declamation, argument, epilostary 

Musical education is less important

	- What do they need? I will either sit with you and you copy me or I will get an advanced student to work with you. 
	-  if we assume that teaching is also learning then being instructed by mentors to teach others is still helping a one to learn.

### Features of Helenistic Pedagogy

very artificial and without understanding, e.g. going through all sylable even if they don't appear in the greek language. The connection to phonics and how to speak the syllables is very loose. Many students aren't learning with understanding. 

Mental gymnastics is basically bicep curls for literacy. 

### State of the art of letters: literacy is an uninterrupted smear of capital letter's.

In modern world we live in sophisticated punctuation e.t.c 
Reading is much harder then - unspaced, unbroken, mapping of phonics to a stream of capital letters.


Advances in the technology of the way we read and write, coincide with innovations in pedagogy and the way we teach. 

Students have tablets and stylus. Women became a symbol for education in Hellenistic education and some women became teachers. Many in literacy, less in rhetoric. 

Women are coming into the workforce and the student body. If you could afford it you could get it.

During this period where does one go to get that elite, societally advancing sophist type education? Where are the best places to do that now?

### Name + First 4 letters of the alphabet.

- There's a sense that the rote and robotic isn't the best, people throught they should make things not in order and instead jump around. "No don't do them isn sequence"
- Greek words are long and polysyllabic so learning rote combinations of letters as syllables before words was necessary but drilled like crazy.

Your task as a student is to expand on these points


### what did plato's education ideal look like?

- not the same military focus as Sparta but still barracks. Sparta++ but with a different aim.
- Children can't make up new rules of the games, only the guardians decide
- This was not about turning you into a scribe or a musician, it was shaping your dispositions and preference to know the good and the beautiful when you see it. If someone shows you the good you're drawn to it, if its bad you're repulsed from it. 
- Designed to sort people and move then through as a cohort to identify who is excellent and who isn't
- time is constant, performance is variable, how much you learn varies. the same time. 
- Plato doesn't want you to learn the same thing, you learn for a time and what you get good at you get good at.

#### Plato's quadrivium

- arithmetic (number in the abstract), 
- geometry (number in space), 
- music/harmonics (number in time), and 
- astronomy (number in space and time).

Was that level of abstraction (e.g. numbers in space) articulated at the time or only later?

# Aristotle's view

![[Screenshot 2022-02-23 at 09.17.15.png]]
Focus on good judgement - that's what a good education gets you
That you can see a domain and say that there's some good stuff in there and some bad but not to just come up with rhetoric or sophist argumentation - They have a matured sense of their own view. 

Very scientific and first principles and systems thinking

Serj. Scholars have understood for the last two generations that the historical Pythagoras didn’t do any mathematics. He led a spiritual, ascetic movement interested in purity and reincarnation. However, a few Pythagoreans in later generations were very distinguished mathematicians. In particular Philolaus of Croton and Archytas of Tarentum (a contemporary of Plato) were very influential, and very influential on Plato specifically

What does education grounded in the sense actually look like?

What's a valid syllogism

Aristotle - analytics, the categories, equivocation.

### Aristotle's Trivium 

- Grammer: Categories 
- Logic: Des Interp, prior analytics, posterior analytics 
- rhetoric: Rhetoric, Topics
	- Redefines Rhetoric towards getting towards the truth
