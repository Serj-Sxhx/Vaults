### Identity

_“There are goals other than well-being, and values other than goals.”_ - Amartya Sen, 1984

One of the trickiest sources of regret is when we made a choice based on ill-informed values or goals. For instance, we have all made choices based on price where later we wished we had considered another factor as more important. Or sometimes we make purchases based on the mistaken idea that we will continue with a certain project.

Goals 

_cognition is forming goals some of these goals are values. Goals such as impress the boss and anti goals such as don't_

_The goal of fitting in and the goal 

setting expectations - The goal of changing others e.g. People should be more vegan, punctual, philanthropic.

Meeting expectations - the goal to fit in socially e.g. People should

Values - Are different to goals in that they're to be practiced. 

You can view a car as a tool and assess it based on it's utility for achieving goals. 

Or you might view a car as an environment and assess it based on its capacity to support you values. e.g. is this usefull to me 

Let's take another example.

This happens all the time. Perhaps a goal was overly specific, was dependent on some other goal in a way we didn‘t understand, was founded on a misunderstanding, or was just less compelling than a goal or value we hadn’t thought of yet.

In which situations do our values shift in this way? And how can we make sure that users remain in charge of their own values, rather than having them directed by the device? 

Philosopher Ruth Chang has argued, it seems likely that we define and adjust our values while making choices. 

Specifically, we evolve our values when we have an initial difficulty making a choice because one option seems better in some ways, and another better in a different way. 

Dr. Chang suggests✱ ✱ It would be good to have better data about these moments of value reconsideration.these are the moments where we reexamine and change our values, and that we often choose _a new, more general value_ for ourselves that makes the choice more clear.

If this is correct, we need a name for the environments in which this activity of self-construction can proceed fluidly. We will call these _environments of expressive choice_. 

To make an expressive choice, users must be able to explore a space of values that might apply to the choice, and to organize the options _in front of them_ in terms of whatever they decide _matters to them_. As simple a thing as providing widgets for changing the sort order and filtering of options creates more possibility for expressive choice.

If menus are to help us find decisions we won‘t regret, they must allow us to explore what’s important to us about the options, and to navigate according to what we've decided is important.

### Visible Promises

_“Ads sell a great deal more than products. They sell values, images, and concepts of success and worth.”_ — Brene Brown

Without an idea of what the user hopes for with a choice, it seems impossible to surface information about better options or related values. We will start our redesign with the notion that when the user has decided to engage with a resource—to go to an event, to use an app, to buy a product, to follow a link, etc—it's because she has a hope, because she is taken with the _promise_ of the engagement. This promise could be the _outcome_ she hopes will result, it could be a _value_ embodied in the choice itself, or it could be an outcome she wishes to avoid. ✱
