# Chapter 1 
Everything degenerates in the hands of man. He mutilates everything and deforms the world, his dog, his horse, his slave. he loves deformity, monsters.

He wants nothing as nature made it.

Our species does not admit of being formed halfway. In 

> Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of
things; everything degenerates in the hands of man. He forces one soil
to nourish the products of another, one tree to bear the fruit of another.
He mixes and confuses the climates, the elements, the seasons. He
mutilates his dog, his horse, his slave. He turns everything upside
down; he disfigures everything; he loves deformity, monsters, He
wants nothing as nature made it, not even man; for him, man must be
trained like a school horse; man must be fashioned in keeping with his
fancy like a tree in his garden.

> Were he not to do this, however, everything would go even worse, and
our species does not admit of being formed halfway. In the present
state of things a man abandoned to himself in the midst of other men
from birth would be the most disfigured of all. Prejudices, authority,
necessity, example, all the social institutions in which we find ourselves
submerged would stifle nature in him and put nothing in its place.
Nature there would be like a shrub that chance had caused to be born
in the middle of a path and that the passers-by soon cause to perish
by bumping into it from all sides and bending it in every direction.

It is to you that I address myself, tender and foresighted mother,* ' [Screenotate Trial]
