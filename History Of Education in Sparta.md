> Tyrtaeus Fr. 10 West 1-18 For 'tis a fair thing for a good man to fall and die fighting in the van for his native land, whereas to leave his city and his rich fields and go a-begging is of all things the most miserable, wandering with mother dear and aged father, with little children and wedded wife. For hateful shall such an one be among all those to whom he shall come in bondage to Want and loathsome Penury, and doth shame his lineage and belie his noble beauty, followed by all evil and dishonour. Now if so little thought be taken of a wanderer, and so little honour, respect, or pity, let us fight with a will for this land, and die for our children and never spare our lives. Abide then, O young men, shoulder to shoulder and fight; begin not foul flight nor yet be afraid, but make the heart in your breasts both great and stout, and never shrink when you fight the foe.

Tyrtaeus was a 7th c. BCE elegiac poet, closely associated with Sparta

 What is perhaps more distinctive of Spartan values is the idea that a single act of cowardice suffices for exile and complete social shunning of one’s entire family. —be willing to risk your life in battle, or suffer a fate worse than death, including pariah status and the social displacement of your family.

### (A) Xenophon Constitution of the Lacedaimonians 2.1-2; (B) Plutarch Life of Lycurgus 16.4 

> A. In the other Greek states parents who profess to give their sons the best education place their boys under the care and control of a tutor [paidagōgos] as soon as they can understand what is said to them, and send them to a school to learn letters, music and the exercises of the wrestling-ground....Lycurgus, on the contrary, instead of leaving each father to appoint a slave to act as tutor, gave the duty of controlling the boys to a member of the class from which the highest offices are filled, in fact to the “Child Warden” [paidonomos] as he is called. He gave this person authority to gather the boys together, to take charge of them and to punish them severely in case of misconduct. He also assigned to him a staff of youths provided with whips to chastise them when necessary; and the result is that modesty and obedience are inseparable companions at Sparta.” B. But Lycurgus would not put the sons of Spartans in charge of purchased or hired tutors, nor was it lawful for every father to rear or train his son as he pleased, but as soon as they were seven years old, Lycurgus ordered them all to be taken by the state and enrolled in companies, where they were put under the same discipline and nurture, and so became accustomed to share one another's sports and studies.”

Elsewhere in Greece, a child of 6 or 7 would be assigned to a private nanny or guide, usually a slave, called a paidagōgos.  The pedagogue would guide the child and perhaps take him to a school or teacher, also privately funded for and operated. It was the decision of the child’s father or legal guardian what education he would receive and what discipline 3 would be administered for any misbehavior.

In Sparta, all boys were turned over to the authority of the paidonomos, garrisoned in barracks, and made subject to discipline from all older boys and men

### Xenophon Constitution of the Lacedaimonians 1.3-4

> First, to begin at the beginning, I will take the begetting of children. In other states the girls who are destined to become mothers and are brought up in the approved fashion, live on the very plainest fare, with a most meagre allowance of delicacies. Wine is either withheld altogether, or, if allowed them, is diluted with water. The rest of the Greeks expect their girls to imitate the sedentary life that is typical of handicraftsmen—to keep quiet and do wool-work. How, then, is it to be expected that women so brought up will bear fine children? But Lycurgus thought the labour of slave women sufficient to supply clothing. He believed motherhood to be the most important function of freeborn woman. Therefore, in the first place, he insisted on physical training for the female no less than for the male sex: moreover, he instituted races and trials of strength for women competitors as for men, believing that if both parents are strong they produce more vigorous offspring.

### Plutarch Life of Lyc. 28.1-3

> Now in all this there is no trace of injustice or arrogance, which some attribute to the laws of Lycurgus, declaring them efficacious in producing courage, but defective in producing justice. The so-called ‘krypteia,’ [or secret service], of the Spartans, if this be really one of the institutions of Lycurgus, as Aristotle says it was, may have given Plato also1 this opinion of the man and his constitution. It was of the following nature: The magistrates from time to time sent out into the country at large the most intelligent seeming of the youths, equipped only with daggers and necessary rations. In the day time they scattered into obscure and out of the way places, where they hid themselves and lay quiet; but in the night they came down into the highways and killed every Helot whom they caught. Oftentimes, too, they actually traversed the fields where Helots were working and slew the sturdiest and best of them.


In short, the krypteia was an educational tool that trained the next generation of future Spartan leaders in brutality.

restrict the music and poet that whip you up into frenzied courage. The poets only write about how dieing for sparta is the highest acheivment. those who fled.

The choir at festivals is the old singing of their youth, the young boasting about their abiality to fight on the front line.


### Aristotle Politics 8.1337a21-32

> [I]nasmuch as the end for the whole state is one, it is manifest that education also must necessarily be one and the same for all and that the superintendence of this must be public, and not on private lines, in the way in which at present each man superintends the education of his own children, teaching them privately, and whatever special branch of knowledge he thinks fit. But matters of public interest ought to be under public supervision; at the same time we ought not to think that any of the citizens belongs to himself, but that all belong to the state, for each is a part of the state, and it is natural for the superintendence of the several parts to have regard to the superintendence of the whole. And one might praise the Spartans in respect of this, for they pay the greatest attention to the training of their children, and conduct it on a public system.

Aristotle is usually a critic of the Spartans, but here he Praises them for having a public education system and one which is aimed at the interests of the state as a whole. As Aristotle indicates, elsewhere in Greece education was a private matter, but Aristotle believed that it should be a public matter as it was a principal public concern.

For Aristotle, the purpose of the state was to ensure that its citizens could live good lives, and the most important factor in having a good life was having a good character. This required a good upbringing. Therefore, the goal of the state could only be achieved if there was adequate education. Likewise, the state could only function properly if it had good 6 citizens who had been properly educated. (Unsurprisingly, education, including curriculum, is a key topic in Plato's and Aristotle's political works.)

# Live Call Notes

The polis teaches the man - Children are being enculturalated 

The polis is a city state, a form of government. By the 600s everybody in greece thinks that the polis is aweseome - It develops its citizens, 

it shapes the behaviour of adults through nomos - law, customs influencing the plasticity of the mind

if you view that the place that the child is growing and everybody agrees on that then you'll think it's good at effecting the children. 

Take a bad person. Theives and scoundral. Did the polis raise that guy. 

How far does that get you with respect to the goals of education. 

### The emergence of higher education

The highschool probalem - hat happens between 13-18?
- Do you work?
- Do you go into politics?

If you weren't elite you would just go and work

if you were elete, in the 400s you take electives, horse back writing, fighting in heavy armor.

There's a real structure to the deep issues of life, it's not religion and it's not cosmology.
A 'higher education' emerges and they're the minority. - They give you a 'philosophy PHD' 

- Plato's academy
- lycium
- garden
- Stoa 

We move from polis makes the man to - What is virtue and how do you aquire knowledge.
This shifts education

What do normal people want to do?

Rhetoric - taught by sophists
1. Do not have enduring schools
2. Not local athens, all polis have sophists
3. They told you they could turn you into a good person.

Sophists made a lot of money, it was a credential and they actually advanced your political career through rhetoric. This bends education towards language education. They agitate the theory vs practice at the time and give the emerging 'middle class' practical tools that cost alot.

Sparta has a large slave economy (helots) who are their neighbors. They don't import. they just concur their neighbors and enslave them. 7:1 helots: spartans. Shared language, shared culture but they have not power. Constant threat of slave uprising.

Helots threaten slave revolt. Spartans become very good at policing them. So they militarize not because they want a huge empire. They don't want a huge empire because if they're away the helots over take them. 

Culture dies because Sparta becomes so militaristic. Literary, artistic, scientific culture dies around 675.

Tyrtaeus was reputedly originally an Athenian or even a Milesian but became adopted by Sparta—but that was at the end of Spartan openness just before it all shifts. After that shift, Sparta doesn’t produce notable poets AND they do not admit poets and intellectuals from the outside

laconic - the ideal is to not speak that much. the focus on letters is less and speak is less.

State had a maximized role, parents had a minimized role.
