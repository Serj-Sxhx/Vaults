This note is in response to Ray Girn's article on Montessorium.com, titled 'The Coming Golden Age of Pedagogy'

His thesis is 

> Thesis:the promise of ed tech, to be realized, is wholly dependent on the understanding and adoption of a fresh pedagogical framework.



What is a fresh pedagogical framework? How does it need to be disctinct from our current pedagogy.

Software has not yet 'disrupted' education. 

What is stopping software from transforming education?

What else could it be besides the usual culprits of a lack of incentives and insufficient financing?

First let's broaded our perspective from school to learning as this will reveal why software is blocked from disrupting education.

Youtube makes possible unprecedented self-directed learning.

For that to be possible you need to be a practiced, goal-oriented learner. 

But if you're not, you're at risk of being distracted by cat-videos or watching content thats too far our of your zone of development such as how black holes work for the content to be useful.

Recommendation engines can be powerful if they are optimised for learning, not for engagement. 

How might we optimise a recommendation engine for learning? 

The web is rife with content that is optimised for engagement, not learning. For edu-tainment to be both engaging and conducive to learning we have to provide robust ways to integrate thinking and doing in our content.

Gaming and gamification has long been held as the best way to interweave thought and action. 
Enabling flow in learning is essential to bridge the gap. 

Some pedagogical problems:

1.  What *is* the architecture of various foundational knowledge and skill domains—with respect to acquisition? We’re better at “standards” than at methods.
2.  How do we truly solve for “transfer”—that is, real, future-oriented understanding?
3.  How does one scaffold “learning by doing”?
4.  What is the nature of healthy, sustainable motivation, and how do we systematically inspire it in individual learners?
5.  A big one: how do we *combine solutions* to the above so that they don’t trade off against one another?

Wha is the relationship between between cognitive development, character development, enculturation, and vocational training.

> As the printing press made possible books in the vernacular, unlocking freedom of conscience; as property rights made possible industry, unlocking material abundance; so software promises to make possible high-agency pedagogy and to unlock human self-creation.

Buy the software alone is not sufficient, we need a new approach to pedagogy which provides answers to some of these deepest questions. Rebuilding the core of pedagogy will require us to disrupt some bedrock of everyday life, approaches like self directed learning, mon
