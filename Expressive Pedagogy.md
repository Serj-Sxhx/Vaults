### Context and Construction

Whats the goal of this piece?
To explicate the basis for a theory of moral development and point to a design practice that education system designers can adopt to support the development of character in the people they serve. The reader should leave understanding how an individual develops 'character' through a process of refining their 'values' by the process I outline.

TL:DR 

People have debated 
What values are, 
if they're teachable, 
if schools should play a part in cultivating specific values or be values neutral, 
how values are cultivated in an individual. This last question is the focus of this essay

There'

Montessoris pedagogy is has a position on what values lead to a meaning full life, and creates norms in the classroom which support practice of these values. It makes it easier to practice X Y Z and not A B C 

Non obvious takes
- What you call values probably aren't values but that's okay we just need to agree on semantics. 
- There are no objective values. Values plurality is a really helpful requirement for the kind of moral development I argue for 
- Schools aren't / don't need to be the only insitution or environments that help learners to articulate and live by their values. In fact they might even be one of the worst places to develop character. 
- Ads sell more than products, they sell ideals and 
- The rate at which we're having self reflective moments may be orders of magnitude higher in built and virtual environments than in the classroom.
- 

What is virtue?
Designing for goals
Designing for emotions
Why are traditional design methods inadequate?
What are values?
	It all starts with attention
Value pluralism
- There are contexts to be honest, times to be ruthless
- Are there objective values?
- There might be clusters of overlapping and adjacet values. We might be able to call these clusters archetypes. But like the elephant in the buddhist parabel we'll only ever touch one part of it. But together we can piece together a more complete picture of these invisible structures if we communicate. 
- We spend alot of time thinking of goals but not thinking about our sources of meaning.

In this article I want to explain how character is developed in an individual through an ongoing process of reflecting on our personal values as we move through social games and interfaces.

I'll touch on how failing to design for values results in depression, loss of agency, and disengagement. I'll point to practices we can adopt as pedagogues and system designers to support Maximise an individual's Time well spent' 

Time well spent: The time spent living by an individual's self defined sources of meaning arrived at through reflection.

Certain topics I'll skim through as i'm trying to get to the meat of my argument which is the implications for thinking in these terms for education. If you ever want to go deeper on any of these topics I've linked to the text book that these ideas are fully explicated in  ['Values-based social Design'](www.google.com)

What are values, what they are not.

Okay so we know that values are attentional policies which we're all not very articulate about. 


# Choice making and social games

When we're faced with the choice of what to buy, or what social games

- [[Ruth Chang]] Hard choices - We try to apply scientific calculus to moral dilemmas. The problem with this is that this mathematical comparison can only result in 3 states. More than, equal to less than. 
- Moral calculus is not like this. We can construct infinite combinations of logic when weighing or comparing questions such as, Should I attend by step-brother's house warming party or stay at home and tend to my elderly mother who's only visiting for the weekend? 
- 
- Or in our monthly retrospective meeting with senior managment, shall I be intellectually honest about the challenges we're facing as a team, or do I want to approach with a curiocity as to the problems. 

In both cases you could construct cohesive logic to justify attending to either. It's through reflection that we're able to refine our personal values, our sources of meaning, so that when we approach moral dilemmas we're able to maximise the time we live by our values, reflect to refine our values and minimise regret by avoiding attending to things that mean that I.

When you doom scrolls on facebook and instagram, when you decide to impress new friends at the expense of your close friends. When you're making choices that are 

But why does this happen? i'll get into this later


Designing Time well spent

If we want to reduce the time you 

Regretful decisions


If we can create infinitely many rational lines of logic

If we can construct and logic to justify our choices in any two comparable choices what should we let guide our attention in those moments? 

What should should your apply your attention to in those moments?

What could you remember could you remember to make sure that you don't make regretful decisions? 

What might you come back to to ensure that this choice is meaningful
