**Choice architecture**: is the design of different ways in which choices can be presented to [consumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer "Consumer"), and the impact of that presentation on consumer decision making

For example, each of the following:

-   the number of choices presented
-   the manner in which attributes are described
-   the presence of a "default"

can influence consumer choice. As a result, advocates of [libertarian paternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_paternalism) and [asymmetric paternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetrical_paternalism "Decision-making") have endorsed the deliberate design of choice architecture to nudge consumers toward personally and socially desirable behaviors like saving for retirement, choosing healthier foods, or registering as an organ donor. 

This raises the question if these interventions are  justified and moral. 

Arguably well-designed choice architectures can compensate for irrational [decision-making biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases "List of cognitive biases") to improve [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics "Welfare economics").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture#cite_note-Thaler-5) 

These techniques have consequently become popular among policymakers, leading to the formation of the UK's [Behavioural Insights Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_Insights_Team "Behavioural Insights Team") and the White House "Nudge Unit" for example.

While many behavioral scientists stress that there is no neutral choice-architecture and that consumers maintain autonomy and freedom of choice despite manipulations of choice architecture,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture#cite_note-Johnson-7) critics of [libertarian paternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_paternalism "Libertarian paternalism") often argue that choice architectures designed to overcome [irrational decision biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) may impose costs on [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Soft paternalism") agents, for example by limiting choice[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture#cite_note-8) or undermining respect for individual human [[agency]] and moral autonomy

What if our the choice architectures we design promote critical thinking of the choices presented? How might the choice architecture itself make it's deficiencies visible to the consumer? 

# Elements of choice architecture design

Behavioral scientists have grouped the elements of choice architecture in different ways. For example, Thaler, Sunstein, and John P. Balz have focused on the following "tools" of choice architecture: 

- [defaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect_(psychology) "Default effect (psychology)")
- expecting error 
- understanding mappings (which involves exploring the different ways that information presentation affects option comparisons) 
- giving feedback 
- structuring complex choices
- creating incentives.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture#cite_note-Thaler-5) 
- 
Another group of leading behavioral scientists has created a typology of choice architecture elements dividing them into those that **structure the choice set** and those that **describe the choice**. 

Examples of choice set structuring include: 
- the number of alternatives 
- decision aids
- defaults
- choice over time 

Describing choice options include: 
- partitioning options and attributes 
- designing attributes
