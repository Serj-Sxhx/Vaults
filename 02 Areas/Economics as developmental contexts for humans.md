Oshand: The thing about socio-economics is that it's very much about designing the conditions for human development to occur. It's very much an educational program of the way in which society is designed, our material environments and social realities create the context / environments in which human beings develop. I wonder how ideas of human development have factored into the way in which you think what kinds of institutions we should be designing for.

Communication is so fundamental to human life that we can't think about our desires as separate from the way that we communicate them to each other. therefore the purely individualistic of utility is not really meaningful.

If we broaden the notion of education beyond just what occurs in schooling but what occurs in a social environments it gives rise to new lines of designing things to set the conditions so that people can engage in the diverse behaviors and explore meaning making outside of becoming useful to an economy. They need to formulate meaningful social goals.
