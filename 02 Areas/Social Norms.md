[[Social Norms]]
[[Field Tripping @School]]

: Norms are prescriptions of conduct (It's more than that) which restrict or support what values we can practice.

: norms are expectations stating that something should or must be the case



# Norms in Learning
Good norms enable productive learning interactions. 

Norms of intellectual engagement shape what people learn and what values they can or cannot practice

Norms do not regulate behavior; they regulate conduct. Riding a bike without falling involves behavior. Riding a bike down a crowded sidewalk involves conduct 

Erving Goffman, who introduced the study of norms, proposed that people are compelled to follow norms due to a universal rule: "The rule of behavior that seems common to all situations... is the rule obliging participants to 'fit in'" 

Freud's work in psychology would suggest that people's reality principle would dictates that by fear of rejection from the tribe, people form the the goal to fit in to allow society to operate smoothly a maintain a sense of belonging.

Figure X shows an example of norms developed by students in a teacher preparation class at Stanford university. The large words, Safe place, Team, Equity are the values that students agreed upon. 

Values are beliefs about what is important to pay attention to. 
Norms are prescriptions of conduct, 

and in the figure they appear above or below the text for each of the values. For instance, for Safe Place, a norm that support living by that value is "Challenging the idea not the person."

Figure X offers norms for general classroom participation. Different communities, different schools and MOOC's, have different norms. Norms differed across contexts and spaces. 

Different topics or practices have different norms of engagement. 

For dangerous military operations, there might be a norm of "following authority without question"

For scientific laboratory's a norm might be to "rely on evidence and logic over authority"

If people engage a new situation following an undesirable norm - for instance, children coming to school believing they should comply or accept the decision of bigger people regardless of their own beliefs - teaching them a new norm can take work. 

An important task of instruction is to help novices learn the norms appropriate to a particular topic of learning. 

*learn the rules so you can break them like a pro - Name*
*Japanese 3 stages from Imad*

We've all had that friend who doesn't take their shoes off and walks into the house putting dirt all over your carpet. Or a foreign guest who eats a different way to us. Many of these customs and forms of 'etiqute' are prescriptions of conduct. 


# Karl Opp's Norms
The aim of the paper is to focus on the evolutionary emergence of norms, focusing on 'large groups' where a simple member does not perceive herself as having the chance to develop a norm in the group, either by means of negotiation or by means of other action.

Thus , if we explain the emergence of norms , we explain under what conditions individuals express new normative statements.

### Definitions
 
behaviour (or a behavioural regularity such as arriving on time for work, taking regular meals, annual holidays, etc.).

preference for a behaviour (people differ in the extent to which they like arriving on time for work, etc.)

articulation (expression) of a norm regarding a behaviour (people state that one should come on time for work, etc.).

acceptance (internalization) of a norm (people think one should come on time for work, etc.).

measures for enforcing a norm (informal social controls such as ridicule; formal controls such as salary deductions).



### Norms emerge in a variety of ways 

1. Institutions may prescribe behaviors (Institutional norm formation)
2. Social contract (Voluntary norm formation)
3. Emerge without intent (evolutionary norm formation)

The process described stars by identifying recurrent behavior, leading to the development of preferences for a behavior, ultimately to the acceptance of norms (internalization) and enforcement of those activates.

Many norms emerged across the middle ages across the centuries independently of any social contract or institutional sanctioning
e.g. table manners 

Some norms are collective / public goods


### 3.3 Evolutionary norm formation.

The process in question here has been described in many different ways: norms are 'the unreflected result of social development' (Menger, 1883, p. 164), they develop as a result of trial and error (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959, p. 140), in an 'unplanned and obscure manner rather than by deliberate inauguration' (Davis, 1966), in a process of gradual change (Demsetz, 1967, p. 34) or they develop 'spontaneously' or in an evolutionary way (e.g. von Hayek, 1979).

**The critical difference from 1. and 2. is that the formation and enforcement of evolutionary norms are not explicitly stated or planned.**

 
implicitly, propose that the emergence of norms depends on the costs and benefits which are associated with them. Thus they too adopt an economic approach (for reviews see Frey, 1980; KirchgaBner, 1980). For example, the emergence of norms has been said to depend on the 'gains' people get (Berger & Luckmann, 1969, p. 57) or on the satisfaction of certain needs (Davis, 1966, p. 109)


### 5.2 The emergence of recurrent behaviour


Situations leading to regular behaviour

*Direct rewards* - Members of a group may take actions with high benefits with low costs and do not need to bargain to adopt behaviours. e.g. using an umbrella if it is raining.

*Imitation* - successful models are imitated. if preferences of models and observers are similar (see Bandura, 1969, 1971)

One learns during the socialization process that sirn high status people (prestigious, powerful, competent, etc.) consistently receive higher tha rewards than others. It thus becomes intrinsically rewarding to imitate these people. Should the such models perform certain kinds of behaviour, or change their behaviour, it will be mo imitated for intrinsic rewards, and behavioural regularities will emerge: the behaviour of 1 the high status individuals becomes diffused .

*Social Structures*
Communication structures
Power Structures
Exchange structures
