Network effects: mechanisms in a product and business where every new user makes the product/service/experience more valuable to every other user.

In order of strength:

1. Physical (Land line telephones)
2. Protocol (Ethernet or bitcoin)
3. Personal Utility (Whatsapp or Messenger)
4. Personal (Facebook)
5. Market Network (Angel list or honeybook)
6. Marketplace (Ebay Craigslist)
7. Platform (Windows, iOS, Android)
8. Asymptotic marketplace (Uber, Lyft)
9. Data (Waze, Yelp)
10. Tech Performance (Bittorrent, Skype)
11. Language (Google, Xerox)
12. Belief (currencies, Religions) 
13. Bandwagon (Slack, Apple)


# Define: Networks are made up of 

- Nodes
	- Can have different roles in the network.
	- Varying Impact, power, value, responsibility
- Central Nodes
	-Have high number of links and are more valuable
- Marginal Nodes
	- Have less connections and less value || Exception if they have a few links to Central Nodes
- Links
	- Not all links are equal 
	- They vary in strength = durability x closeness x activity
- Directionality
	- The direction of a link between nodes is determined by which way, if any, the interaction between nodes in a network flows.
	- Directed: Influencer > Viewer - unreciprocated effect, information flows one way
	- Undirected: User > User Bank Transfers (Venmo + personal utility networks) - Bidirectional information flows
	-  networks encompass a mixture of directed and undirected connections. Understanding the directionality of links in your network and mapping them visually leads to far better product design and prioritization of features.
- One-to-Many
	- e.g. Youtube - A creator makes one video an is watched by many other viewers on the network.
- One-to-one 
	-	e.g. Facebook messenger - A user can message one person and they can message that same user back. 
- Network Size 
	- The number of Nodes in the network
- Network Density 
	- The ratio of links to nodes 
	- e.g. 2450 L : 50: N is a high density network
	- e.g. 100 L : 1000 N is a low density network
	- The higher the density the more powerful it's NFX
	- Density is uneaven across a network which leads to Clustering
- Clustering 
	- e.g. Some people are more active in sub channels in 
	- Bridge: When two clusters are connected by a solitary link



# In building products,
- pay attention to the interactions and how nodes form connections with each other so you can design your product to promote higher network density. 
- Look for the “white-hot center” of your network—the densest, highest activity part—and focus the product features and language on activating other users to be-have more like that group
- Their activity will attract other nodes who will be inspired by the activity of the “white-hot” group, and it will radiate outward from there much faster than you might think
