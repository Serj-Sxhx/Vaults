Dear Reader. 

I've been trying my best to map the perennial problems and translate them into accessible non academic & world religion language.

This is the original sketch that John gives us

As per John's account, what's required is an ecology of [[Psycho Technology]]s that help us to overcome the Perennial Problems. 

I've been doing work in similar and overlapping spaces as part of the team that birthed https://meaning.supplies/. A site where you can find social practices for different 'values'

I've also participate and actively support communities of Authentic Relating, Circling and the [Monastic Academy](https://www.monasticacademy.com/).

### Fancy helping?

1. Below are definitions of the perennial problems and their solutions. If you have any suggestions for language that you could use to explain all of this to your grandma then please reach out via [twitter](https://twitter.com/Serjhunt_ARK) or email Serj(at)paideiaxpraxis.com

2. I work with a team who design psychometric for learning analytics and strongly believe that psychometric assessments can be made for the dimensions outlined by John. My hypothesis is that this would radically change the way we allocate resources in therapy and even the way we think about public health and wellness for both local communities and from a policy standpoint. Psychometric assessments are a long road to design. If you know anyone in this field who would be open to collaborating on this, or has design psychometric assessments before then please contact me via twitter or email (above)
3. Got a [[Psycho Technology]] social practice, game or therapy style that solves perennial problems? DM me or comment and let me know what perennial problem it relates to, often it's multiple. I'll be making a list of practices and redesigning this list soon [here](https://coda.io/d/Suite-of-Practices-Social-Arts_dWxc2daM6zY). If it's a social practice then consider leaving it on [meaning supplies](https://meaning.supplies/)

### Definitions
![[Perennial Problems.png]]
 
 The perennial problems are of course perennial because the very machinery of our cognition that makes us adaptive also makes us perpetually vulnerable to self deceptive behaviours. And because of the affordances of the arena that our cognitive machinery operates in and through.
 
 Most cultures cultivate an ecology of [[Psycho Technology]]s typically in the form of a religion for addressing the perennial problems but that set of psycho technologies has to be fitted into a legitimizing and sustaining worldview.

Dynamical Systems version: [[Wisdom]] Wisdom is a dynamical systems that is counter-active to the machinery of self deception that helps to afford self organized transformation into a life of flourishing. A life that is deeply meaningful.

Slightly Woo version: Wisdom is knowing how to make the transformative leap of self-transcendence from the every day world to the real world.

Grandma-ish version: It is your capacity to overcome self-deception and to enhance your contact with reality. There is also a psychological component. It’s also the capacity to avoid self-destructive behavior.

Wisdom is a set of practices which overcomes the [[Perennial Problems]]
The 7 perennial problems are:

### Structural - Self Organizing Self

- Parasitic Processing 
	- **Discussed in:** [Episode 13](https://awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com/episodes/13)
	- “The very processes that make you adaptively intelligent also make you vulnerable to self-destructive behaviour.” We use adaptive heuristic shortcuts to zero in to the relevant/crucial information. After a bad event, your brain immediately tries to anticipate future events like it. This can cause a downwards spiral. [Source](https://awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com/parasitic-processing) Like a parasite it takes up life within you and it takes life away from you. It causes you to lose your agency and to suffer.
	- bad event trigger spirals of thoughts it become a very complex self-organizing system that takes on a life of its own becomes very compelling very adaptively resistant to our attempts at intervention.
	- Solution: Cultivate a counter active dynamical system - parasitic processing is a very complex dynamical system and if you try and do one-shot interventions it just reconfigures itself what you need is to cultivate and internalize a counter active dynamical system A prototypical example is the cultivation of the 8 fold path in Buddhism.


- Modal Confusion 
	- (Inadequate)  to get into confusion between the having and the being modes - See Zeno / Buber / Fromm
	- Solution: Sati - practices that are designed to invoke a deep remembrance of the being mode. Sati isn’t an insight about this or that problem, but is a fundamental insight into what it is to be a human being. A systematic set of insights that optimizes your entire being. That triggers and empowers a fundamental transformative experience. [Source](https://awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com/sati)


- Reflectiveness Gap 
	- This comes from the fact that what we can do is we can step back and look at our own processing. This gap affords us regaining our agency from the chaos of being the impulsive wantin. But when we open up the reflectiveness gap too much we got als a loss of a agency we get the tragedy of Hamlet and of course some middling position is not the answer there because at times you have to be highly reflective at times you have to be highly immersed.
	- Solution: Flow State - the combination and dynamic integration, not just a settled median point, a dynamic integration of immersion and creative flexibility.

## Structural - Agent Arena Relationship
** Self-World Relationship**

- Absurdity 
	 - Clash of perspectives (meaningless-ness)
	 - Solved by ven diagram of humor and absurdity. the intersection is here and made clear that all of the arguments for absurdity like what happens a million years from now it doesn't matter I'm is so small I will die none of these things actually matter (Too zoomed out) My life is the only significant thing (Too zoomed in)
	 - Solution: Scantia Intuitiva or Prajna - I can scale down I can scale up and then I can get the state of non-duality that is simultaneously scaling up and scaling down and that actually alleviates the clash of perspectives. Move from Either or to And mind

**Self-Self**

- Anxiety 
	- As Inner Conflict and Bullshitting, also has a time dimension. Holding narratives of the future or past that skew the salience landscape making it  susceptible to bullshitting.
	- Solution: Inner Dialogue - the idea of internalizing the sage right as the child is to the adult the adult is to the sage an exemplary example of this is the Christians it's not I who lives but Christ who lives in me or the Buddhists you have to realize your Buddha nature or the Stoics I have to internalize Socrates
	
- Alienation 
	- alienation this is our inability to connect to other people  (Alone / Worthless?)
	- Solution: communitas - this is the sense of connectedness to other and part of that is to try and recover what we had in platonic dialogue.

### Developmental 

- Existential Entrapment
	- EX Inertia + EX Ignorance = Existential Entrapment (Stuckness)
	- A need for anaegoge - Anagoge is the Greek word for the climb towards the metaphorical light that represents a clearer view of reality. [Source](https://awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com/anagoge) The word is closely related to Plato’s cave myth. In this myth, the climb towards reality is what we call anagoge. How do I anegoge out of this worldview into another worldview?
	- Solution: Gnosis - Enacted / Embodied Symbol. Gnosis means elevated ‘[[participatory knowing]]’, rather than any kind of supernatural state. We experience gnosis when we “become one” with a higher reality. For examples, when we hear music, we sometimes feel one with the composer of that music. Another example John Vervaeke describes is the feelings he had by reading Spinoza. While doing this he has moments beyond mere intellectual understanding, where he starts to ‘know’ the being and mind of Spinoza from the inside. “Many people are seeking Gnosis today. Gnosis is the kind of thing you need in order to bring about a release from the existential entrapment that we’re finding in the meaning crisis.””
	-   Recognise there's an alternative (world view / Identity) that's legitamate and desirable - `Supported by` *Near death, Challenging life circumstances, Exposure to inspiration, Mythos, Psychedelics, Altered states*
	-   Not running away from responsibility
	-   Actually creating new environments

	>To change yourself change the environment, To change the world change yourself
