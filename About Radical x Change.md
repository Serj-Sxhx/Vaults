About RxC

  

RadicalxChange is a global movement dedicated to moving beyond capitalism and bringing about new, better political economies. RadicalxChange Foundation is a nonprofit focused on cultivating this work.

  

Backstory

  

We started in 2018, harnessing the excitement around the book Radical Markets. That book collected several innovative ideas that pointed toward a more vital democratic practice and a fairer economic order. In particular, Radical Markets:

  

-   described a new way of voting, called quadratic voting, that could let large groups of people make more nuanced democratic decisions, and
    
-   outlined a new form of partial common ownership, according to which property possessors would not enjoy permanent monopolies on what they owned, and would have to share appreciation in their asset values with the communities around them.
    

  

We got together because we felt these ideas needed to be experimented with! They just might unclog democracy, and alleviate the concentrations of wealth and power that are distorting our social and political lives.

  

To bring about such profound changes, RadicalxChange practices radical interdisciplinarity. We bring together activists, technologists, policymakers, academics, and artists -- and people from all backgrounds, political ideologies, and walks of life -- so that they can learn from one another and build together.

  

Since 2018, RadicalxChange has grown to encompass chapters of enthusiastic activists all around the world. We’ve hosted three major conferences, published influential research on governance, identity, AI, and data, and stewarded pathbreaking experiments in democratic practice -- including implementations of quadratic voting in public deliberative bodies in Brazil, Taiwan, and Colorado. 

  

RadicalxChange Foundation, meanwhile, has grown into a developer of in-house participative and deliberative technologies. Many of our ideas about improving democracy and scaling deliberation are embodied in RadicalxChange Voice, an adaptable tool for forming shared goals, which we hope will become a governance building block for democratic institutions both new and old.

  

Blockchain

  

RadicalxChange has dovetailed heavily with blockchain communities from the beginning. This is because blockchain technology might be part of the answer to how we transition from one set of institutions to another. 

  

RadicalxChange’s vision does not necessarily depend on blockchain technologies. In fact, we are fairly agnostic about how to get to a better world from where we are today. Some visions of a blockchain-mediated future are exciting, and others are worrying. 

  

Nonetheless, by giving society an opportunity to experiment with reprogrammable money, voting, and property systems, blockchain technology is largely responsible for bringing about the opportunity RadicalxChange hopes to seize. Conversely, RadicalxChange ideas appeal to many blockchain innovators as a framework for the institutional and governance transformations that they know are possible.

  

Data Dignity

  

A key theme for RadicalxChange is devising fairer systems for control, ownership, and governance of data. This does not mean simply “data ownership.” That’s too simple, because data never pertains to just one person, or even one institution, or one group of people. To make the data economy fair and coherent, we need to devise ways of exercising subtle, broadly-shared control over the flows of information. 

  

To this end, our [Data Freedom Act](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/papers/data-freedom-act.pdf) draft outlined an ambitious agenda for policymakers. Technologists in fields such as proof of personhood and privacy-enhancing technologies are today building critical pieces of infrastructure that could underpin a future in which data is governed and shared fairly, for the benefit of everyone. But this is not guaranteed! We all need to pull together to make it happen and get our shared digital lives back on track.

  

Participation Technologies and Democratic Innovation

  

“Science has provided the possibility of liberation for human beings from hard labor, but science itself is not a liberator. It creates means not goals. Man should use [Science] for reasonable goals. When the ideals of humanity are war and conquest, those tools become as dangerous as a razor in the hands of a child of three. We must not condemn man’s inventiveness and patient conquest of the forces of nature because they are being used wrongly and disobediently now. The fate of humanity is entirely dependent upon its moral development.” -- Albert Einstein

  

Technology presents a lot of dangers -- but the biggest danger of all is thinking that it is pulling us toward some foregone conclusion. Instead, we argue for a redefinition of progress -- a cultural, institutional, and economic reassessment of which kinds of technological advances are most valuable for society.

  

This is the idea of participation technology. If technology in general refers to tools that make it easier to accomplish individual goals, or pre-defined collective goals, participation technology refers instead to tools that make it easier to form shared goals.

  

The most striking episodes of human progress actually come from advances in our ability to legitimately form shared goals through social processes like democracy and education, rather than advances in devices like cars and computers. Participation technology rigorously re-centers those shared endeavors as the aims of new technical capabilities.

Here are some examples of the distinction:

  

Participation Technology

General Technology

Tools cultivating shared interests

Tools privileging their wielders

Education (Wikipedia, investigative journalism, liberal education: practices that aim for full epistemic equality between participants.)

Propaganda (Facebook, public relations, certain kinds of professional training: practices that do not aim for epistemic equality between participants.)

Democracy (Pol.is, quadratic voting, in-person deliberative techniques)

Hierarchy (surveillance technology, physical coercion technology)

Conversation Facilitation AI (AI designed to provide helpful and transparent context for interactions between humans, like a mediator or facilitator)

Human Manipulation AI (AI designed to deceive or influence humans for a third party’s purposes)

  

Participation technologies can improve just as substantively and exponentially as any other technologies! However, the market under-invests in them, because their gains are inherently more widely distributed, and less capturable for private-gain-seeking shareholders. This is a big part of the problem with capitalism, that we hope to help address.

  

And More

  

RadicalxChange is a loose, open, and tolerant community. We’re going to need everyone to have a stake in the work of upgrading democracy and building a better political economy -- so we think it’s important to seek common ground, and to bridge differences. 

  

In light of the huge local, national, and global challenges ahead, this work is critical and urgent. So, thanks for joining!! Feel free to reach out personally to Matt Prewitt (matt@radicalxchange.org), Jennifer Morone (jennifer@radicalxchange.org), or Paula Berman (paula@radicalxchange.org) with any questions about the organization or the conference, and enjoy!
