### Morning Writing

I focus on 3 main themes

1) Why Ed-Tech has failed to disrupt the classroom and alternate approaches to designing & deploying Ed-Tech.
2) Adaptive learners, and how to support [[Guy Claxton]]'s notion of  'Results +'
3) Cross cultural anthropological studies on human development, learning networks and communities of practice.


- ### Academic Journey
	- What is a human, is there a fundemental language underneeth all our different cultures
	- Studied Music Technology It was a Bachelor of science undergrad program which blend of Making audio software, physics, music theory and creative music production. Human Computer Interaction design.
	- 
	- I had already covered most of the 1st year syllabus. before coming to UWE and i noticed that
	- But I realized that i only had about 10 hours of contact time per week so in formaly attended lectures in business and economics, Physics, philosophy, psychology and digital media.
	- I ended up at a hackathon in a part of Bristol that was tackeling a challenge to do with over population and housing in a scpecific part of town - During this hackathon I Bumped into Ruth crick and Shao fu Huang who were leading researchs of a specific field of learning sciences that has to do with Learning Power. 
	- It really affiremed my intution that there was much more to education than about acheiving good test results
	-  that the role of education was much wider than that and that triggered this huge self learning process of pedagogy, psychology, human development. 
	-  After i left university I identified that i had to see how other cultures were exploring this topic of human developent and following years I began to immerse myself in 
	- Over the following 6 years after leaving university i kept reading ruth and her collaborators research and ended up in Bali - everyone kept,
- How did you entered in the world of education?

- ### The concept of Paidea and Praxis
	- Paidea X Praxis is the name of my personal site where i share notes, on the research and projects that I'm doing across 3 sort of major themes. 
	- **Theme 1** is based on observations by Justin Reich's observations in his book "Failure to disrupt" 
	- 
	- who is the director of Comparative Media Studies at MIT, in his book he noticed that 
	- 
	-   that many founders of ed-tech platforms kind of come in with this view that education technology will democratize education and will disrupt the status quo. 

	-   If technology falls from the sky into a school - If it's kind of relatable to existing ways of doing things it might see some good adoption. But if it's kind of novel and introduces new relationships between teachers, students, curriculums, environments and assesments then it wont be so readiliy adopted.
	-  Teachers are often just thinking about, how do i do things to extend existing practices. To shift this hugely complex system of education has a developmental trajectory 
	-  from doin things in more familiar ways 
	-  to using things in slightly novel ways 
	-  to doing really imaginative work. 
	-  So what's required to to build really strong communities of practice around new technologies to help shift the practices. 
	-  This leads to a kind of design mantra of 
	-  Community over content.
	-  Practices for propagation.
	-  Scratch is a great example 
	- 
	- **Theme 2 ** what guy claxton calles Results + & Learning power
	- [[Learning power]]
	- [[The Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]
	- ![[03 Resources/Attachments/Learner Agency.png]]
	- 
		- Squeez the grades from your child and We'll make them a good statistic in the SAT's, PIZA tests or GCSE's
		- There's always some rhetoric on what else they're providing and what other desirable outcomes 
		- The questions is what is the +
		- And what are the implications for pedagogy, curriculum, environments and assesments.
		- If we're not serious about the + 
		- We might fall back into acting like the only thing we care about is Result.
		- And if this happens then we'll have negative impact on other charteristics 
		- Not teachers is waking up in the morning and thining goodies - im going to do everything in my power to make my students 
			- less creative,
			- more un adventrous
			- more compliant 
			- Less collaborative
			
		- But some how we keep having this effect. 
		- This was what the late Sir Ken Robinson was banging on about. that school are enourmously good a kill a childs creativity. 
		- Basicly if the underlying pedagogy isnt specifically designed for the + Then we run the risk of Delivering on Results minus
	
	- ** The 3rd theme ** is more focused on the beginning of a child's learning and development, the family. It's more of an anthropological and sociological theme centered around the heavy taboo of Parenting strategies.
	-  I'm curious about how we got to this place and specific social structure where parent's unconsciously adopt fairly poor parenting strategies, and also what we can do to prevent the very malleable, sensitive and adaptive mind of a child being exposed to event's that stunt their development.
	-  I'm exploring questions of how different social structures, norms and practices lead to different behaviours and characters in children. 
	-  Children are basically born and and exposed to position of powerless up until their early teens and depending on how they navigate that powerless ness or not sets up alot of their character going forwards.  
	-  Some areas of observation are distinct differences of children in societies where child rasing is more of a community effort with multiple rolemodels, 
	-  Another is the role of nannies and people who's profession is to care for children in the modern family - Should we have people who's job is to 
	-  Another are of investigation is the demands placed upon parenting while participating in the modern workplace and economy. Are there certain policies or structures that would allow parents to spend more time with their children instead of being continually disengaged. 
	-  The differences between children who's parents go through a divorce. 
	-  
	


- Social Arts Handbook
	- This is a handbook written by m
	- We're trying to popularize and make accessible some ideas developed by our time working with joe edelman at Human Systems. 
	- One goal of human systems was based on joes observation that we already have advanced design methodologies for Building tools. 
	- but we didn't have a cohesive design methodologies social systems - systems made of people, where there are codified and mutually understood roles and responsibilities. Range from _dinner table conversation games_ to _social networks_ and _global governance structures_.
	
	- Where many single player tools and apps have design thinking, social systems, like classroom social practices were lacking a a cohesive design and process so we tried to formalise some of that to support designers. 
	- Nathan and I noticed that we wanted to make it relevant to creating spaces for meaningful personal development. 
	- The core theme we try to lay out which is a theme that runs through social arts and Paideia X praxis is the lense of all social environments as a type of game. 


- What is it?
	
- Edu Creator
	- 
- Why did you decided to do it?
	-	Helping course creators to build online courses. 
	- I knew so many smart people who didn't know how to get their ideas online, or needed support with building a diital business
- 
- For how long have you working on it?
	- it tool me about 1.5 months to build but it's really the result of two years of creating notion templates for client work. Now im in that phase where It's got a core group of users 
- 
- What's the general feedback you're getting?
	- Great. People like the UX of it. 
	- It's helped people to free up more time to do other things. 
- 
- You have a lot of visual elements scattered throughout your digital
	- The logo is many things - there are many triads are very interesting to me 
		- Shiva, vishnu brahma
		- Creator destroyer, maintainer 
		- It's also a strange loop with a homage to the work of Goedel the mathematician and M C escher the artists who was interested in the recursive, structures.
	
	- The colours are inspired by the 4 main colours and phases of the alchemical process, black yellow, white and red.

## Three key features of Educational that are central to understanding why technology doesn't lead to disruptive society, shifting change in education, in the way it does in other fields. 

First education is just immensely almost, unfathomably complex.
Somewhere today, there was a teacher, it was a seventh grade earth science teacher who is starting a new unit on plate tectonics. And somewhere else, there was a kindergarten teacher who across a zoom video conference was
trying to explain to students how to open a new tab in a browser or how to tie their shoes. And somewhere else, there was an advanced Mandarin class being taught in a in a liberal arts college.

It's not just that those subject areas and those contexts are different. But what you do the interactions you have with your students day to day, the the content that you cover the skills that you address, they're constantly changing across the 180 days of a K 12 school year or the 28 weeks of a two semesters of higher education. It's extremely difficult to think about how technologies could be built to address all of those kinds of diverse use cases.

And indeed, the technologies that we have, are very uneven. They work well in some circumstances, but not others for some people, but not others, in some contexts, in some subjects, but not others.

Fundamental misunderstandings that people often have of when they predict sweeping changes from education technology. They're imagining that our technologies are like bulldozers, or they're like Swiss Army knives, they sort of clear everything out or they do everything.

But our technologies are not that way. They solve very particular problems. I think these are problems that sort of cut across these different kinds of approaches to learning at scale. So one has to do with complexity, and I call it the curse of the familiar. If you build a technology that is familiar to people, you can get that technology adopted.

And when you glance at the operation of the Quizlet website, you will instantaneously understand what's going on, you go Oh, this is a flashcard. Like I'm gonna write question on one side and answer on the other side, I'm gonna test myself, I'm gonna share the decks with other people. These are flashcards because it is instantaneously recognizable, it can spread very, very widely. But if we sat down a bunch of experts in the American education system and said to ourselves, like, what are the real problems that we face here in education with inequality? With the challenges of the future of the labor market? What do we really need to work on here? I think very few experts would come up with the answer like, man, we really have a dearth of flashcards out there in the schools like we really have to improve flashcard access for children across the

United States he new flashcards are neat, but they because they don't offer any kind of substantial change in the way that teachers and students interact with one another.

But they're, they're not sort of unlocking new pathways of teaching and learning. By contrast, we do build things that unlock new pathways to teaching and learning. Users often find them confusing. So if we create things, new technologies that incorporate alternative pedagogies, or create new routines or relationships between teachers and students, it's often the case that this confuses teachers and students. And these things sometimes get passionately adopted in small niches, but very rarely spreading scale across systems. In the cases in which we do have some of our most interesting technologies, sort of get into schools and start to spread and start to change the way teaching and
learning happen, they tend to do two things

--- 

some approaches to addressing these intractable dilemmas. They tend to be able to be used for familiar ways initially, and then span out into new kinds of opportunities. So Quizlet gets in in a very simple way with flashcards, but doesn't really take you anywhere beyond flashcards. I have colleagues who built this graphing calculator tool called Desmos, which is at first glance just does everything a ti 84 calculator does on your computer for free. But then beyond that, there's a whole set of ways of using this graphing software that enables a whole different kind of approach to teaching and learning and mathematics. And so it meets people in a familiar place and takes them somewhere else. And then the second thing that people do when they successfully navigate the curse of the familiar, and this is sort of a theme that cuts across both the book failure to disrupt. And a lot of my current critiques of how we're addressing online learning during the pandemic, is that the people who are good at taking technologies and spreading them and having new pedagogy spread with them. They don't assume that new ideas will travel with the technology. They assume that they have to engage communities of faculty members, teachers and learners in pedagogical exploration about how to do new things. So the you know, MIT Media scratch lab, they built scratch, but they are also in the midst of building this giant apparatus to teach people all over the world. What are the pedagogies of computational creativity that are associated with scratch because scratch by itself, if you sort of drop it into schools, it will be it will be, you know, domesticated by those schools for conventional teaching and learning. But it provides an opportunity for allowing people to remember And those ideas, but only if faculty and students and communities are supported in doing that learning and doing that rethinking you know, it's a, it's a way of thinking about the scaling of new ideas, not through technology distribution, but through movement making, through community building through the kinds of things that we see in other forms of social movements.
