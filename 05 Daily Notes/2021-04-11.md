>Mystery not mastery

Message from Dad

It was lovely talking with you yesterday - So nice to hear how you are getting on. Hope we can get you out here soon. Just wanted to say that I believe in you and all that you are doing. I am so pleased to hear that you do not doubt what you are doing. Keep to what you believe. It may not bring you flashy cars immediately (I know thats not what you want). Make sure you are happy. Love you
