: _Agency _simply means “the quality of being capable of taking action”. You and the people around you seem to have agency; while rocks generally do not. Inanimate objects are sometimes granted agency in a kind of humorous quote marks (eg “the washer decided to break today”); Agents _(entities that have agency) have_ goals _or_ purposes_, and the actions they take are seen as being in pursuit of these goals. Agency thus implies some rudimentary_ rationality_, and a degree of _autonomy_.
