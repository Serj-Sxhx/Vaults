[[Opera Didactica Omina (1657)]]


>Comenius was also the author of _Janua linguarum reserata_ (_The Doors of Language Unlocked_), which is by far the greatest language textbook of all time, being reissued and in circulation until the end of the 19th century (close to 300 years). The same is true of his _Orbitus Pictus_ (_The World in Pictures),_ which applied the novel use of print technologies to create a language textbook that was also the first picture book for children and young adults. **These books were used to teach Latin all over the world and were written using an unprecedented innovation where a picture was followed by two columns, one describing the picture in a native language, the other with the same description in Latin.**

Its just brilliant to constantly realise how little I know and keep discovering
