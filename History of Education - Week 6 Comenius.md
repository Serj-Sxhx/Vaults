Where are we? There's a revived sense of grassroots scholasticism. Aristotle, logic becomes dominant and science really advancing.

He's influenced by Bacon and his circle, Decartes, Galileo, Newton

1600s 



Comenius has two works which impact the intelectual scene.

1. The Great Didactic

2. His textbooks

Teaching literacy in analogy with teaching them orally by showing things then showing the word for them. 

Language should be learned by picture book and by generalist 
knowledge of everyday scenes that one might encounter. 

These are not arcane and ancient settings.

1. Ordered by by what you can see in front of you.
	- You start by what is first accessible to a learner's senses - very Baconian. 
	- How do you do history because history is not available to the senses? Systematically build a child's sense of time. 
	- How do you teach shapes? Comparison after knowing this is a square, this is a triangle, what's the difference? 


2. It's kind of weird to study law by studying the dystinion codes. Or logic by commentary on aristotle
	- What's going on with the field and present it to the child
	- what's an example? Newton comes along and see the world with gravity not Aristotle's sciences. Don't study newton like a work of the classics, how did newton figure this out? Comenius want's people to understand by scoping an sequencing contemporary knowledge.
	
Augustine says memorise, then you understand it.
Comenius says start with accessible stuff, the lords
