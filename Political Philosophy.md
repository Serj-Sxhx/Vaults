- Thomas Hobbes: Leviathan 1651
	- What would the world be like if there wasn't a state?
	- Would that world be better or worse?
	- What would life be like in the state of nature?
		- People are all roughly equal
		- All of us are at risk of 
		- The work that we do disrupted by others
		- Loss of property
		- Important things destroyed by others 
		- We need to spend a lot of time protecting our goods
		- The fear of war is enough to disrupt work
			- It's in our rational self interest to give ourselves to a sovereign, 'The laviathan'
	- Who says so?
	- What makes the state legitimate?
- John Locke: Two Treatises of Government 1689
- Jean Jaque Ressoau: Social Contract Principle 1762
- John Rawls: Theory of Justice 1971
	- > Justice is the first virtue of social institutes as truth is of systems of thought, 
	- Just as a scientific theory is useless if it's false, an institution is not legitimate if it is unjust.
		- Primary assumption: Each person possesses a certain inviability which cannot be overridden even for the greater good.
			- This challenges the utilitarian view: That an act is morally right if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people.  If I face a choice between saving one person and saving five where I can save only one group or the other, utilitarianism gives what many people find to be the intuitive answer that I should save the five, thereby bringing about more happiness rather than the one.
			- The famous counter example to utilitarianism: a healthy man walks into a hospital where there are five dying individuals, one in need of a heart, one in need of a kidney, one in need of a liver and two others each in need of parts that he has.  The utilitarian rubric would seem to suggest that if those five can be saved by harming him that that’s what morality demands
		- How should the benefits and burdens of living together in a community be distributed so as to best realize what justice requires?
			- What are the fundamentals of a just society?
				- One that rationals, free and equal people would want to contract into.
					- But we enter into interactions with all sorts of inequalities. 
					- If we try to build our society taking into consideration those facts about ourselves we aren’t doing it from a position of equality, so Rawls’ insight is that **sometimes the fairest way to make a decision is to put yourself in a position where you have less information**.
					- The Veil of Ignorance: If you divide a cake unaware of which slice you'll get, You will divide it fairly.
					- Do we care more about fundamental rights? or do we care about the distribution of benefits?
					- Consider these 3 Hypothetical Societies
					-  ![[Screenshot 2021-09-02 at 10.51.30.png]]
					- To the extent that there are inequalities in a society they should satisfy two conditions. So the first condition is that 1) The benefits of those inequalities be accessible to all and 2) To the extent that are inequalities in a society they should be distributed in such a way that they are to the benefit of the least well off. 
						- e.g. If low taxes on the rich trickle down to the benefit of the least well off then thats okay. 
						- 92% of Americans chose the more equally distributed graph. 
	- What does a just society look like?
	- How should a just society be structured?
- Robert Nozick: Anarchy State and Utopia 1974
	- > "Individuals have rights and there are things that no person or group may do to them without violating those rights. The minimal state limited to narrow functions of protection against force, theft and fraud, enforcement of contracts and so on is the most extensive state that can be justified.”
	- The conditions under which property is legitimate
		- In a legitimate way from someone who owns it 
		- Or in a legitimate way from no one owning it. 
		- E.g. Say each of us has $100 and there are thousands and thousands of us all of whom are fans of the great 1970s basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, so suppose you give 25 cents of your money to Wilt Chamberlain and I give 25 cents of my money to Wilt Chamberlain and our friend gives 25 cents of his money to Wilt Chamberlain and so on thousands and thousands of times. Until Wilt Chamberlain comes to have not the $100 with which each of us started out, but thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.  In Nozick’s view any decision to take away any of the money which Wilt Chamberlain got through this voluntary and legitimate transaction is a violation of rights. **Then no distribution of income, including one in which 1% of the people own 99% of the wealth could ever be illegitimate because what matters is how it actually came into being.**
		- Individual decisions that are acceptable, may be problematic if large numbers of people make those decisions

# Tragedy of the commons
e.g. so suppose there is a green area where I let my cow graze and you let your cow graze and our neighbor lets his cow graze.  So far no problem, for each of our cows there is enough to eat, but suppose that each of us instead of having one cow has 50.

- If you alone had 50 cows there would be no problem. 
- If I alone had 50 cows there would be no problem, 
- but if hundreds of us have 50 cows the entire green space will disappear and all of our cows will die.  

This structure manifests itself in situation after situation.  Over fishing results from each of us taking what would be a fine amount of fish if were the only ones doing it, but an amount that becomes problematic if others are doing likewise.  Each of us polluting a small amount causes no problem.  All of us polluting together can lead to drastic consequences.
