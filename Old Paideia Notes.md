The title is a bit of a wordplay with a double meaning. 

The first meaning is invoked by pronouncing the intermediate X as 'eX' of the Latin root suffix meaning 'out'. This is to point to a central problem that the work here aims to address. That we don't have an optimal or shared common Praxis for sustaining [[social autopoiesis]].

The second is arrived at by noting the X as a multiply symbol. Here the Paideia is amplified by a shared community of practice.
