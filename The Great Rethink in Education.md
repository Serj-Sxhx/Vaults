The Abolition of man C.S. Lewis 

> This confusion is continually present in language as w use it. We appear to be saying something very important about something about our own feelings. 

> Their words are that we 'appear to be saying something very important when in reality we are 'only saying something about our own feelings'.

> The very power of Gaius and Titius depends on the fact that they are dealing with a bot: a boy who thinks he is doing his english prep and has no notion that ethics theology and politics are all at stake. 

Does this not beg for inter-diciplinary learning and the removal of subjects.

The importance of 'great' true and beautiful writing or canonical content is very important. Or at least reference to the difference of what's being presented and those works. 

> Gaius and Titius, while teaching him nothing about letters, have cut out of his soul, long before he is old enough to choose, the possibility of having certain experiences which thinkers of more authority than they have held to be generous fruitful and humane. 

> The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defence against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. 

> Until quite modern times all teachers and even all men beleieved the universe to be such that certain emaotional reactions on our part could be either congruous or incongruous to it. Believed in fact that objects did not merely receive but could merit our approval or disapproval, our reverence or our contempt. (Objective Value)

> It is the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are. Those who know the Tao hold that to call children delightful or old men venerable is not simply to record a psychological fact about ow own perental or filial emotions at the moment but to recognize a quality which *demands* a certain response from us wheather we make it or not.

The TAO places demands and constraints on us. The best place to hide a limiltless being is in a limited being. How are we limited? 

> I myself do not enjoy the society of small children: becayse I speak from within the Tao I recognise this as a defect in myself - juast as a man may have to recognize that he is tone deaf or colour blind. and because our approvals and disapprovals are thus recognitions of objective value or responses to an objective order, therefore emotional states can be in harmony with reason. 

Why are you not able to access the limitless and ineffible is to recognise your own edge, bound or shortcoming. Each a stress, tangle or knot which prevents Tao or Li to flow through you. 

> Hence the educational problem is wholly different according as you stand within or without the Tao For those within, the task is to train in the pupil those responses which are in themselves appropriate whether anyone is making them or not, and i making which the very nature of man consists. 

> Those without, if they are logical, must regads all sentiments as equaly non-rational, as mere mists between us and the real objects. 

> course the difference between the old and the new
education will be an important one. Where the old
initiated, the new merely ‘conditions’. The old dealt
with its pupils as grown birds deal with young birds
when they teach them to fly; the new deals with them
more as the poultry-keeper deals with young birds—
making them thus or thus for purposes of which the
birds know nothing. In a word, the old was a kind of
propagation—men transmitting manhood to men;
the new is merely propaganda. 

> It may even be said that it is by this middle element that man is man: for by his intellect he is mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal.
