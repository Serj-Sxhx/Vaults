The Abolition of man C.S. Lewis 

> This confusion is continually present in language as w use it. We appear to be saying something very important about something about our own feelings. 

> Their words are that we 'appear to be saying something very important when in reality we are 'only saying something about our own feelings'.

> The very power of Gaius and Titius depends on the fact that they are dealing with a bot: a boy who thinks he is doing his english prep and has no notion that ethics theology and politics are all at stake. 

Does this not beg for inter-diciplinary learning and the removal of subjects.

The importance of 'great' true and beautiful writing or canonical content is very important. Or at least reference to the difference of what's being presented and those works. 

> Gaius and Titius, while teaching him nothing about letters, have cut out of his soul, long before he is old enough to choose, the possibility of having certain experiences which thinkers of more authority than they have held to be generous fruitful and humane.
