MIT gets founded in 1870s
Normal schools explode.

Thorndike, Hall, James - It is good for memory of this stuff, but not memory in general. 

Education really became the practical application of these social science fields.

What is this education for. 

Human capital theory / views of humans.

If I was an education reformist, what would I change.

### 1. Humanism (Elliot, Harris)
- The school has a role to play in preserving society. It grounds people in a common language. It's Conservative, it's about providing the bedrock of societal values and world views. It's got a focus on classics

### 2. Herbartianism (DeGarmo, McMurry)
- Argues for interdiciplanirary approach to education.
	- Agree
- Let's do 6 weeks on egypt. looking at myths, economics, robinson cruso, what does he need to survive, nutrition, geology
	- They didn't have a word for inter-diciplinary, the call this 'Concentration' on a specific topic and draw out general lessons. 
	- The argument for this is that this is how children naturally see the world. It kills the child's interest. This is how schools should work. 
	- Let's get rid of disciplines.

### 3. Developmentalisits / Child study movement (Hall, Parker)
- These are scientists
- We can reform education based on scientific findings.
- Hall makes a bunch of recommendations for when children learn or can understand things based on surveying loads of children about any topic, when does a child know when they know something. 
- Focused on effectiveness, not efficiency 
	- Some where

James, (principles of psychology). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology

- Darwinian influence as his theory takes root.
- Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny
	- What does that mean?
	- If you look at the foetus, the evolution of a foetus recapitulates or is a microcosm version or accelerated version of the evolution of life or the species
	- in education, the thing to know in education is that people thought the development that children go through differnt phases of learning and development that kind of replay the tape of civilisation. 

### Vocationalists: efficiency theorists (Rice)
- Why don't we just teach students to do jobs
- The idea that school should be practical. 
- General skills

### Social Reformers: 
- What should we do with minority groups, moral decay, decline arguments.
- Mann argument. Schools can be places that we teach people to be good and align society. 

Progressive education is a loose synthesis of points 2-5
Dewey basically has cutting disagreement in places with all of these.

### Dewey

Starting Points
- The university school , based on his lab school
- Montessorium Articles


- He's a pragmatist along with James, purse
	- You first have plato, to train the mind by studying abstract things - Rationalism
	- Learn things from the senses, you experience things and the you make generalised claims - Empiricists 
	- Pramatists think that you should solve problems and cognition is really about problem solving. That knowledge is gained through problem solving. It's about practical problem solving and knowledge gained by action. 
	- It's not just that knowledge is motivated by action, you come across a problem so you need to understand it and you're motivated to solve it, but more deeply that the very act of wanting to do something and experiencing resistance from the world and then tinkering and trying to figure out what works and what doesnt, is thinking and is Knowledge for them.
	- We are trying to solve problem in the world collectively as a species and each of us as an individual has a role to play.And thats a messy process of experimentation in pursuit of a goal.
	- For dewey education is about preparing one for life in a specific form of society. 
		- So what is our societal context - And individuals don't come ready made for a society. It's a socialisation as we say now. 
		- You

You can't directly convey beliefs, emotions and knowledge. It is truly educative in it's effect in the degree in which an individual share or participates in some 'Some conjoint activity' - they learn via social games.

Ancients believed that you need to develop civic virtue to participate in society. Dewey is way more explicate, in trying to help young people to participate. 

The Dewey - University, Laboratory School
![[Screenshot 2022-04-18 at 13.05.50.png]]

- Divided into three three-age bands 4-7, 7-10 and 10 to 13
- Divided into three subjects: Manual training, history and literature and science.
- Manual training e.g. sheep shearing, carpentry, mainly to develop social cooperation. There were real sheep, they would replicate the industrial process. Designed to be group cooperation. Learning division of labour and working together towards a common goal.
- As you get older you do history, literature and science. Principles were taught through "occupations" in a vaguely Herbartian kind of way.
- controversially. he was roussevian about literature. You shouldn't rush the teaching of letters, you should wait for the child to have a need for it before drilling literature.
- Lots of experimentation 

### what's going on inside

Driven by intinsic motivation. More just in time vs just in case.

- Some kind of balance between just in time vs just in case. 

### William Kilpatrick "The Project Method"


![[Screenshot 2022-04-18 at 13.14.43.png]]

There are 4 tyeps of projects

1. is to build something, a boat, a theater play
2. Art, read a poem,
3. solve a problem that's not a practical problem but an intellectual problem. e.g. student 'Reads that the boston massacre never happened'
