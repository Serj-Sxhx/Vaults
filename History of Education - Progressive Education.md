MIT gets founded in 1870s
Normal schools explode.

Thorndike, Hall, James - It is good for memory of this stuff, but not memory in general. 

Education really became the practical application of these social science fields.

What is this education for. 

Human capital theory / views of humans.

If I was an education reformist, what would I change.

### 1. Humanism (Elliot, Harris)
- The school has a role to play in preserving society. It grounds people in a common language. It's Conservative, it's about providing the bedrock of societal values and world views. It's got a focus on classics

### 2. Herbartianism (DeGarmo, McMurry)
- Argues for interdiciplanirary approach to education.
	- Agree
- Let's do 6 weeks on egypt. looking at myths, economics, robinson cruso, what does he need to survive, nutrition, geology
	- They didn't have a word for inter-diciplinary, the call this 'Concentration' on a specific topic and draw out general lessons. 
	- The argument for this is that this is how children naturally see the world. It kills the child's interest. This is how schools should work. 
	- Let's get rid of disciplines.

### 3. Developmentalisits / Child study movement (Hall, Parker)
- These are scientists
- We can reform education based on scientific findings.
- Hall makes a bunch of recommendations for when children learn or can understand things based on surveying loads of children about any topic, when does a child know when they know something. 
- Focused on effectiveness, not efficiency 
	- Some where

James, (principles of psychology). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology

- Darwinian influence as his theory takes root.
- Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny
	- What does that mean?
	- If you look at the foetus, the evolution of a foetus recapitulates or is a microcosm version or accelerated version of the evolution of life or the species
	- in education, the thing to know in education is that people thought the development that children go through differnt phases of learning and development that kind of replay the tape of civilisation. 

### Vocationalists: efficiency theorists (Rice)
- Why don't we just teach students to do jobs
- The idea that school should be practical. 
- General skills

### Social Reformers: 
- What should we do with minority groups, moral decay, decline arguments.
- Mann argument. Schools can be places that we teach people to be good and align society. 

Progressive education is a loose synthesis of points 2-5
Dewey basically has cutting disagreement in places with all of these.
