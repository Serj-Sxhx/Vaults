Context: The goals of education are changing. A.I. is changing the student teacher relationship.

Unshackling from the chains of antiquated academia, let's reimagine education in a world where AI doesn't just write essays to get good grades, but augments our very existence and makes our teachers and learner more human in the classroom. 

Are we ready to break free and soar towards an uncharted future of learning?

The essay will propose new goals and outline new practices and assessments in the education system now that standardised tests, the student-teacher relationship, and needs of the workforce are being impacted by A.I. and Large Language Models such as chatGPT

In this essay, we aim to explore the intersection of education and AI-driven advancements. Our goal is to reevaluate current educational practices, propose new objectives, and develop assessment methods that enhance the student-teacher relationship. 


# What are the current goals of education

In order to better understand the direction in which education should evolve, it's essential to grasp the current goals of Western education and their origins. Broadly, these goals can be classified into three primary categories: 

1. Edification, particularly moral edification: Building strong ethics in students to navigate the world with empathy, respect, and integrity. Guided at first by religious institutions, then shifting towards secular moral education, diverse beliefs and values of contemporary society.
2. Civic-economic competence: Preparing students for active participation in their communities and the global economy
3. literacy and the language arts: Enabling students to access and engage with information in various formats. This has

# We need at first new heuristics to 

Based on Donella Meadows list of leverage points I will outline what I think the mindsets and beliefs are that will allow us to think of the new goals. I will also make an argument for why


Perspectival freedom or cognitive freedom 
fallibilism 
and 'emptiness' in the buddhist definition 

All power us to transcend paradigms. 




I will outline what I thin the new goals are 

### Goal 1: Learner Agency
- What is agency 
- Learning power: 
- What is learning power and how to cultivate learning 
- Assessment: How to assess learning power at a system or app level
- Assessment: How to assess learning power at an individual level

### Goal 2: Meaning in life & Character Development
- Who do I want to be, how do I want to live
- Social Games, 
- Expressive pedagogy
- Assessment: Time well spent

### Goal 3: Developing an Idea to Reality Stack
- Developing an Idea to reality stack
- Assessment: Learning Velocity

### Goal 4: Developing next-gen educators
- Training teachers how to think and speak of themselves in terms of learning power
- support and cultivate learning power in others through coaching and designing personalised interventions and support structures
- Build a web of support around a learner by building learning relationships
	  "You're a product of the 5 people you spend the most time with" 
- This Is something we can intellectualise but few consciously develop this intentionally to improve their learning and quality of life.
- The 'learning relationships' you build are larger factors of life-long happiness and success than grades.

- Systems thinking and complex problem solving
- Debunk the myth that systems thinking is just a sub dicipline of engineering that's reserved for engineers.
- Make the case for why systems thinking is more of a way of looking at the world which is more supportive of the way our brain actually makes sense of concepts, people, skills, and their relations  more so than the way concepts are taught in textbooks and subjects.  

- Assessment: Learning Velocity

- Goal: Career Readiness
- Assessment




A tutor for everychild 
A co-pilot for everychild

The technological barrier is now so low. unlike the laptop for every child initatives which have largerly failed. 

Why did they fail? 

It's now not a technological barrier but a cultural barrier. 

There are norms, practices, expectations and mentrics which reinforce those norms and therefore prevent the adoption of new technologies and practices around LLMs.


My beleifs about what's important to cultivate in young people in this new pardigm and assement for weather or not we're achieving that. 

This essay is all about redesigning

# Summar y

These are both my suggestions for how the public eduation system can adapt to embrace A.I. and  emerging technology and set of principles basis for a new education system that my team are building. It will be slow to respond which is why I've commited to two projects over the next 5 years. 

1) is the project of creating an organisation that creates content, quality assures facilitators and delivers training to schools, universities and states to equip every teacher with these capacities and potentialy save them on their most. For those institutions that are breave enough we'll also consult on the culture redesign and implementation to support new goals in education.
2) Build new infrastructure that's build upon these principles to demonstrate how an education system that's designed to support this is 2x or 3x more effective in for passion to vocation, agency and meaning in life. 

- Statistic about students that do work placement are likely to have better success. 
- Statistic that happiness is about people you spend your time with.
- Statistic about the are higher agency and self-determined.
