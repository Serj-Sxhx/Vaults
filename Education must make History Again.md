> “Times between worlds—liminal epochs—always involve profound educational crises, which can rapidly cascade into total civilizational breakdowns. The ideal response has been to ‘reboot’ the social structure using an updated educational operating system. The best example from recent history — the last time this happened at scale — is the story I tell in this essay.”

> Humans make history when they make intentional changes to the dynamics of intergenerational transmission. This means literally changing how we “pass on” the knowledge, skills, and character traits that make possible the unfolding of what we call history

> This is what might be called “_social autopoiesis”_ —the self-(re)creation of the social body—and it can only be accomplished through intentional practices of education

what are the dynamics of [[autopoiesis]] and how does one maintain it?

[[John Amos Comenius (1592-1670)]]

 > We are once again tasked with countering social breakdown resulting from information technologies by means of educational innovation.

Education reformers, your task is to counter social breakdown resulting from new information technologies by means of educational innovation.

> The pinnacle of this vision is the Pansophic College or Temple of Light. Also called the School of Schools, this organization was to act like a planetary hub or clearinghouse for knowledge, running quality control, printing the latest findings (and those that had been disproven or changed), while also working on the integration of religions with science and politics. All knowledge was to be made available through a universal network of printers and schools that “_taught all things to all people in all ways_,”


But what does it mean to say that education can be the driver of world historical change?

> I believe that educational systems and practices can be reformed in light of patterns revealed through metahistorical analysis.
