[[The ecosystem for self-directed, lifelong learners.]]

What we’re not talking about is a new set of things to do in a classroom or school. Rather, we’re talking about completely transforming our view of young people, learning, and the purpose of education—and seeing what that opens up for us

-   Assessment and credentialing of learning
-   Accountability, resources, and governance
-   Recognizing, supporting, and credentialing adults

# Quotes 


I'm not proposing anything particularly radical. Mimetis is simply an augmentation of how your brain learns and how your social world supports you to complete projects, gain wisdom and be in touch with eachother using empathy.


"What if school, as we used it on a daily basis, signaled not the name of a process or institution through which we could be indoctrinated, not a structure through which social capital was grasped and policed, but something more organic, like a scale of care. what if school was the scale at which we could care for each other and move together. In my view, at this moment in history, that is really what we need to learn most urgently."

-   Alexis Pauline Gumbs: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine mammals

Care and freedom you can increase as much as you like without damaging anything. Who are the people who are providing care, and provide them with compensation so they can be more free.

- David Graeber

Economic as it currently exists is based on assumptions of human nature that we now know to be wrong. There have been empirical tests on the fundamental assumptions on the 'maximizing individual' that economic theory is based on.

- David Graeber



## Learner Centered Education. 
learner-centered education begins with assumptions about the uniqueness of each learner, continues with assumptions regarding the need for education systems to respond effectively to that uniqueness, and ends with assumptions about what learning is and can be.
